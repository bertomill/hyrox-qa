# ADAPTIVE RULEBOOK EN - Part 2 of 14

*Part 2 of 14 from ADAPTIVE_RULEBOOK_EN.pdf (24 pages total)*

4. DIVISIONS, CLASSIFICATION AND RANKING SYSTEM
4.1 HYROX Adaptive Divisions
(a)Lower Limb Impairment
(b)Upper Limb Impairment
(c)Short Stature Impairment
(d)Visual/Hearing Impairment
(e)Neurological Impairment (broken down to the following sub-divisions)
j. Neurological Major
jj. Neurological Minor
(f)Seated Impairment (broken down to the following sub-divisions)
i.Seated With Hip Function (SWHF)
ii.Seated Without Hip Function (SWOHF)
iii.Seated Without Core Function (SWOC)
HYROX Adaptive offers 6 divisions. The divisions differ in gender,
repetition and/or weight. The running/pushing distance remains the same
for all Division (with the exception of the Short Stature and Neurological
Division): all athletes must run or push for 1 km meters between each
workout for a total distance of 8 km, except for athletes with neurological
impairments or short stature, who will complete 1 lap (approximately 350
meters) between each workout.
4.2 Classification
Lower Limb Impairment Division
This division includes athletes with impairments primarily affecting the
lower extremities. These impairments may involve partial or complete loss
of function in one or both legs.

RULEBOOK ADAPTIVE_

Upper Limb Impairment Division
This division includes athletes with impairments in one or both upper
extremities, impacting the arms, hands, or shoulders. These impairments
may result in reduced strength, dexterity, or range of motion.
Short Stature Division
This division is for athletes with a significantly shorter height due to
conditions such as skeletal dysplasia or other growth-related conditions.
Visual Impairment Division
This division includes athletes with partial or complete loss of vision.
Athletes in this category may require adaptations for navigation through
guide runners (see also 7.2 Guide Runner)
Hearing Impairment Division
Athletes with partial or complete loss of hearing are classified in this
division. Athletes in this category may require adaptations for navigation
through guide runners (see also 7.2 Guide Runner)
Neurological Minor Division
This division includes athletes with neurological impairments that result in
minor limitations, typically affecting a single extremity. Examples include
peripheral nerve diseases or similar conditions that cause mild functional
deficits. Athletes in this division may have minor impairments but retain
significant mobility and strength in their limbs.
Neurological Major Division
This division encompasses athletes with more severe neurological
impairments affecting two or more extremities. These conditions may
involve paralysis, significant functional deficits, or severe motor control
issues. Examples include paraplegia, hemiplegia, severe stroke, head
injuries, or conditions like Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS). Athletes in this
division may also rely on orthoses, walkers, or trolleys to assist with
walking.

*Part 3 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

ARTICLE 2 ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATIONS
Under the premise that it is the Athletes’ personal duty to ensure that no Prohibited
Substance enters their bodies, and no Prohibited Method is Used (accordingly no intent,
Fault, Negligence or knowing Use on the Athlete’s part must be demonstrated to establish a
rule violation), the following constitutes an anti-doping rule violation:
2.1 Presence of a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers in an Athlete’s
Sample
2.1.1 Athletes are responsible for any Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers
found to be present in their Samples. Accordingly, it is not necessary that intent,
Fault, Negligence or knowing Use on the Athlete’s part be demonstrated in order to
establish an anti-doping rule violation.
2.1.2 Sufficient proof of an anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.1 is established by any
of the following: presence of a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers in
the Athlete's A Sample where the Athlete waives analysis of the B Sample and the B
Sample is not analyzed; the Athlete’s B Sample is analyzed and the analysis of the
Athlete’s B Sample confirms the presence of the Prohibited Substance or its
Metabolites or Markers found in the Athlete's A Sample; the Athlete’s A or B Sample
is split into two parts and the analysis of the confirmation part of the split Sample
confirms the presence of the Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers
found in the first part of the split Sample or the Athlete waives analysis of the
confirmation part of the split Sample.

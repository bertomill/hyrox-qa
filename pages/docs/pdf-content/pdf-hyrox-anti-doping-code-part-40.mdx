14.1 Information of other Anti-Doping Organizations
Hyrox-World shall be entitled, but not obliged, to inform WADA or other Anti-Doping
Organizations or sports organizations having the authority for Results Management
and/or Disciplinary Proceedings concerning the Athlete or other Person of the results
of Disciplinary Proceedings under this HYROX-ADC upon request. The information
should include a brief summary of the facts of the case and the reasons leading to
the sanction(s) imposed in the specific case. However, no organization shall be
entitled to bindingly request justification of a decision made by Hyrox-World.
14.2 Reporting to law enforcement authorities
Hyrox-World is authorized to report the name of the affected Athlete or the other
Person, their common place of residence, and the substance that led to the Adverse
Analysis Finding or the type of other possible anti-doping rule violation, as well as
other relevant information to the relevant public prosecution, the respective Federal
Criminal Authority, and any other competent investigating authorities, in accordance
with their diligent discretion without delay, and even before notification pursuant to
Article 7.2.2. Notwithstanding this, Hyrox-World shall be obliged to file a criminal
report against the respective Person if there is a suspicion of a violation of law due to
information from Athletes, Athlete Support Persons or other Persons. For the
avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that this shall apply notwithstanding any
obligations to confidentiality and secrecy and any applicable procedural rules.
14.3 Public Disclosure
14.3.1 Hyrox-World may Publicly Disclose the identity of an Athlete or Person charged with
having violated anti-doping rules, the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method and
the type of violation, as well as a Provisional Suspension of the Athlete after the
Athlete or the other Person have been informed in accordance with the International
Standard for Results Management.
14.3.2 [Left blank]
14.3.3 After an anti-doping rule violation has been determined to have been committed by
the Arbitral Tribunal and according to Article 13.2.2 or such appeal has been waived,
or in a hearing in accordance with Article 12, or the assertion of an anti-doping rule
violation has not otherwise been timely challenged, or the matter has been resolved
under Article 10.8, Hyrox-World may make public such determination or decision and
may comment publicly on the matter.
14.3.4 In any case where it is determined, after a hearing or appeal, that the Athlete or other
Person did not commit an anti-doping rule violation, the fact that the decision has
been appealed may be Publicly Disclosed. However, the decision itself and the
underlying facts may not be Publicly Disclosed except with the consent of the Athlete
or other Person who is the subject of the decision. Hyrox-World shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent, and if consent is obtained, shall Publicly Disclose the
decision in its entirety or in such redacted form as the Athlete or other Person may
approve.
14.3.5 Except as provided in Articles 14.3.1 and 14.3.3, Hyrox-World or a WADA-accredited
laboratory, or an official of either, must not make any public statements on the details
of the current proceedings, except for general descriptions of a processâ€™s technical,
legal, and scientific nature, unless this is done in response to the public statements
of the Athlete, other Person, or their entourage or other representatives.

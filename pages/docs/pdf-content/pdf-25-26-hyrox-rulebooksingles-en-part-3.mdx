*Part 3 of 22 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookSingles_EN.pdf (44 pages total)*

Injured racers are responsible for ensuring they have
received medical clearance from a qualified health
professional prior to participating in a HYROX race.
If movement adaptations or modifications to
prescribed weights or repetitions are required due to
physical limitations [whether temporary or ongoing]
resulting from injury, racers must contact the HYROX
team in advance.
If you require any movement adaptations or need to
modify prescribed weights/reps due to injury, please
contact the HYROX team in advance. We will do our
best to support your participation safely.
Please note that any modifications made for injury-
related reasons will result in you being marked as
‘Out of Competition’. You will still receive a finish time,
but your result will be excluded from official rankings
and qualification opportunities.
2.4 PARTICIPATION WITH
PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS
However, please note that any adaptations will result
in your result being marked as ‘Out of Competition’
so you will be excluded from official rankings or
qualification spots, although you will still receive a
finish time.

The participant’s final result time is 1:24 but if they  missed 2 run laps
throughout the competition their final result time will be 1:34 (2 x 5 min
penalties).

If a participant does not complete the workout station in the correct
sequence (1-8), they are permitted to complete missing workout station
prior to entering station 8 (Wall Balls). Completing the workout in the
incorrect order will result in a 3 minute penalty. If more than one workout
is completed out of order, the participant will automatically be
disqualified.

Missing an entire workout station or 1K run will lead to a disqualification.

Each time a participant runs into the Roxzone via the OUT arch, or out of
the Roxzone via the IN arch they will receive a 2 minute penalty.

1-8. Distance penalties depend on the workout and range between 5
meters (for Individual Starters and 10 meters (for Doubles). Time penalties

Penalty decisions can be made by any referee/judge after consensus with
a Head Judge and/or a Race Director.  For Workout Stations 1-7 there will
be one warning per station before penalties apply where movement
standards are not met. With the second warning (of any infringement), the
repetition is considered invalid and the athlete receives the
corresponding distance/time penalty. Any further warning within the
station will result in additional distance/time penalties. Some time
penalties can be issued without a warning and will be based upon the
violation.
12.3 Did Not Finish
If a participant does not finish a workout station they will not receive any
results data and will be excluded from all rankings and awards. However,
they may continue with the race (without a final result time).
12.4 Disqualification
If a participant has been disqualified by a Head Judge they will not
receive any results data and will be excluded from all rankings and
awards. Once disqualified by a Head Judge the participant may not
continue the race.
12.5 Deviations from the Movement Standards
Any execution of a movement that either deviates from the movement
standards, and/or is unusual or uncommon and/or results in a time
advantage will not be recognised and will result in an invalid repetition
(no rep) or a time/distance penalty depending on the workout station.

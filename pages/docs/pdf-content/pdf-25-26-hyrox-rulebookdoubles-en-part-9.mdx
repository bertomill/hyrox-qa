# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 9 of 23

*Part 9 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

All HYROX courses comprise the same distances
and combine the Run Course, Roxzone and workout
station distances.
Both Doubles Team Members [DTMs] must run
together for the entire 1,000m between each workout
station. If one team member runs ahead, a 1-minute
penalty will apply, as this changes the dynamic of a
Doubles race.
1 Complete all workout stations in the correct order.
2 Enter and Exit each workout station via the correct
routes.
3 Exiting a workout station via the workout station
‘IN’ arch will result in a 2 minute time penalty.
4 Complete the prescribed number of repetitions
and/or distances.
5 Perform each exercise according to the movement
standards.
6 Perform the exercises/movements using the
correct weight[s].
7 Only use a piece of equipment/lane/wall ball
station assigned by a member of the Race Crew.
Failure to do so will incur a 2-minute penalty per
infringement.
8 Only event-provided chalk may be used, and only
at the workout stations where it is provided. Chalk
is not to be taken to any other workout stations or
used at different workout stations. Doing so will
incur a 2-minute penalty per infringement.
9 To avoid creating slip hazards for other racers
and staff, the fluids provided at aid stations are
for drinking only. They are not to be used for
active cooling [e.g. pouring water over the head or
body]. Doing so will incur a 2-minute penalty per
infringement.

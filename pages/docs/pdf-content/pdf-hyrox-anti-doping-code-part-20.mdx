# HYROX Anti Doping Code - Part 20 of 43

*Part 20 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

ARTICLE 10 SANCTIONS ON INDIVIDUALS
[Comment by HYROX-World: HYROX-World recognizes the arguments of WADA in its
comment to Article 10 regarding the harmonization of sanctions in sport in principle and is
therefore guided by the requirements of the WADC when implementing the sanction
frameworks. With this HYROX-ADC, HYROX-World has nevertheless made targeted
amendments in order (i) to soften the partially existing generalized nature of the sanction
framework under the WADC/NADC (e.g. limitation of the sanction framework to three months
for Substances of Abuse or rigid minimum periods of ineligibility) and (ii) to broaden the
limited options of WADC/NADC in favor of an increased consideration of the particular
circumstances of the case to the benefit of individual case justice.]
10.1 Disqualification of Results in the Event during which an Anti-Doping Rule Violation
Occurs
An anti-doping rule violation occurring during or in connection with a HYROX event
may, upon the decision of HYROX-World, lead to Disqualification of all of the Athlete’s
individual results obtained in that event with all Consequences, including forfeiture
of all points and prizes. Factors to be included in considering whether to Disqualify
other results in an event might include, for example, the seriousness of the Athlete’s
anti-doping rule violation and whether the Athlete tested negative in other
Competitions. If the Athlete establishes that he or she bears No Fault or Negligence
for the violation, the Athlete’s individual results in the other Competitions (e.g. other
HYROX events of a series) shall not be Disqualified, unless the Athlete’s results in
Competitions other than the Competition in which the anti-doping rule violation
occurred were likely to have been affected by the Athlete’s anti-doping rule violation.
10.2. Ineligibility for Presence, Use or Attempted Use or Possession of a Prohibited
Substance or Prohibited Method
The period of Ineligibility for a violation of Article 2.1, 2.2 or 2.6 shall be as follows,
subject to potential elimination, reduction or suspension pursuant to Article 10.5, 10.6
or 10.7:
10.2.1 The period of Ineligibility, subject to Article 10.2.4, shall be a minimum of two and a
maximum of four years where: [10.2.1.1] The anti-doping rule violation does not involve
a Specified Substance or a Specified Method, unless the Athlete or other Person can
establish that the anti-doping rule violation was not intentional and [10.2.1.2] The anti-
doping rule violation involves a Specified Substance or a Specified Method and
HYROX-World can establish that the anti-doping rule violation was intentional.
10.2.2 If Article 10.2.1 does not apply, subject to Article 10.2.4.1, the period of Ineligibility shall
be a minimum of one and a maximum of two years.
10.2.3 As used in Article 10.2, the term “intentional” is meant to identify those Athletes or
other Persons who engage in conduct which they knew constituted an anti-doping
rule violation or knew that there was a significant risk that the conduct might
constitute or result in an anti-doping rule violation and manifestly disregarded that
risk. An anti-doping rule violation resulting from an Adverse Analytical Finding for a
substance which is only prohibited In-Competition shall be rebuttably presumed to
be not “intentional” if the substance is a Specified Substance and the Athlete can

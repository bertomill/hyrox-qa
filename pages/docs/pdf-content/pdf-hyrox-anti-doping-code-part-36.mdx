No Athlete or other Person who has been declared Ineligible or is subject to a
Provisional Suspension may, during a period of Ineligibility or Provisional Suspension,
participate in any capacity in a Competition or activity (other than authorized anti-
doping Education or rehabilitation programs) authorized or organized by HYROX-
World.
An Athlete or other Person subject to a period of Ineligibility shall remain subject to
Testing. The term “activity” also includes, for example, administrative activities, such
as serving as an official, director, officer, employee, or volunteer of the organization
described in this Article. Ineligibility imposed in one sport shall also be recognized by
other sports (see Article 15.1, Automatic Binding Effect of Decisions). An Athlete or
other Person serving a period of Ineligibility is prohibited from coaching or serving as
an Athlete Support Person in any other capacity at any time during the period of
Ineligibility, and doing so could also result in a violation of Article 2.10 by another
Athlete. Any performance standard accomplished during a period of Ineligibility shall
not be recognized by HYROX-World for any purpose.

10.14.3 Violation of the Prohibition of Participation during Ineligibility or Provisional
Suspension
Where an Athlete or other Person who has been declared Ineligible violates the
prohibition against participation during Ineligibility described in Article 10.14.1, the
results of such participation shall be Disqualified and a new period of Ineligibility with
a length to the original period of Ineligibility shall be added to the end of the original
period of Ineligibility. The new period of Ineligibility, including a reprimand and no
period of Ineligibility, shall be determined with consideration to the Athlete or other
Person’s degree of Fault and other circumstances of the case. The determination of
whether an Athlete or other Person has violated the prohibition against participation,
and whether an adjustment is appropriate, shall be made by HYROX-World. This
decision may be appealed under Article 13.
An Athlete or other Person who violates the prohibition against participation during a
Provisional Suspension described in Article 10.14.1 shall receive no credit for any
period of Provisional Suspension served and the results of such participation shall
be Disqualified. Where an Athlete Support Person or other Person assists a Person in
violating the prohibition against participation during Ineligibility or a Provisional
Suspension, HYROX-World shall impose sanctions for a violation of Article 2.9 for
such assistance.

establish that the Prohibited Substance was Used Out- of-Competition. An anti-
doping rule violation resulting from an Adverse Analytical Finding for a substance
which is only prohibited In-Competition shall not be considered “intentional” if the
substance is not a Specified Substance and the Athlete can establish that the
Prohibited Substance was Used Out-of- Competition in a context unrelated to sport
performance.
10.2.4 Notwithstanding any other provision in Article 10.2, where the anti-doping rule
violation involves a Substance of Abuse:
10.2.4.1 If the Athlete can establish that any ingestion or Use occurred Out-of-Competition
and was unrelated to sport performance, then the period of Ineligibility shall be a
minimum of three months and a maximum of one year Ineligibility. In addition, the
period of Ineligibility calculated under this Article shall not exceed a period of three
months if the Athlete or other Person satisfactorily completes a Substance of Abuse
treatment program approved by WADA/NADA or considered to be equivalent to an
approved program by HYROX-World. The period of Ineligibility established in this
Article is not subject to any reduction based on any provision in Article 10.6.
[Comment by HYROX-World: The determinations as to whether the treatment
program is approved by WADA/NADA and whether the Athlete or other Person has
satisfactorily completed the program shall be made in the sole discretion of HYROX-
World. This Article is intended to give HYROX-World the leeway to apply their own
judgment to identify and approve legitimate and reputable, as opposed to “sham”,
treatment programs.]
10.2.4.2 If the ingestion, Use or Possession occurred In-Competition, and the Athlete can
establish that the context of the ingestion, Use or Possession was unrelated to sport
performance, then the ingestion, Use or Possession shall not be considered
intentional for purposes of Article 10.2.1 and shall not provide a basis for a finding of
Aggravating Circumstances under Article 10.4.
10.3 Ineligibility for Other Anti-Doping Rule Violations
The period of Ineligibility for anti-doping rule violations other than as provided in
Article 10.2 shall be as follows, unless Article 10.6 or 10.7 are applicable:
10.3.1 For violations of Article 2.3 or 2.5, the period of Ineligibility shall be a minimum of two
and a maximum of four years except: (i) in the case of failing to submit to Sample
collection, if the Athlete can establish that the commission of the anti-doping rule
violation was not intentional, the period of Ineligibility shall be a minimum of one and
a maximum of two years; (ii) in all other cases, if the Athlete or other Person can
establish exceptional circumstances that justify a reduction of the period of
Ineligibility, the period of Ineligibility shall be in a range from one year to four years
depending on the Athlete or other Person’s degree of Fault; or (iii) in a case involving
a Protected Person or Recreational Athlete, the period of Ineligibility shall be in a
range between a maximum of two years and, at a minimum, a reprimand and no period
of Ineligibility, depending on the Protected Person or Recreational Athlete’s degree of
Fault.
10.3.2 [Left blank]
10.3.3 For violations of Article 2.7 or 2.8, the period of Ineligibility shall be a minimum of three
years (Trafficking/Administration) or two years (Attempted
Trafficking/Administration) up to lifetime Ineligibility, depending on the seriousness
of the violation. An Article 2.7 or Article 2.8 violation involving a Protected Person shall

# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 8 of 23

*Part 8 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

Only individuals who are citizens or legal permanent
residents of a designated country within each region
are eligible to participate. This excludes temporary
visa holders such as tourists, students, or other non-
resident classifications [commonly referred to as
legal aliens].
Proof of eligibility must be provided through an
original government-issued ID–such as a passport
or permanent residency card. Driver’s licenses or
photocopies of any documents will not be accepted.
Racers who hold dual or multiple citizenships are only
eligible to qualify in one Regional Championship; if they
participate in more than one Regional Championship,
only the time from their first race will be considered
for qualification purposes.
The racer who achieves Podium place 1 of each
Regional Championship becomes directly qualified for
the Double Elite 15 race at WORLDS–if these racers
have already qualified, the slot will roll down to the next
racer in line, so that at every Regional Championship,
1 pair of female and 1 pair of male racers will qualify
for the Double ELITE 15 race at WORLDS.
The only way to qualify for the WORLDS is by placing
at a Major or Regional Championship.
There is no direct qualification to the WORLDS based
on a finishing time in a regular season race.

A HYROX race consists of a 1km run followed by one,
repeated 8 times.
In order to complete the entire HYROX race and
receive a valid finishing time, the racers must start
at the designated start time, complete the runs and
workouts in the designated order [Run 1, workout
station 1, Run 2, workout station 2, etc.] until they
have completed a total of 8 km running and 8 workout
stations whilst wearing their issued timing chip on an
ankle at all times.
HYROX race operate using wave starts at regular
scheduled intervals [e.g., every 10 minutes]. Each
racer is assigned an official start time, which is
communicated prior to race day and confirmed again
at check-in.
Racers must have their official start time clearly
visible on their arm.
1 Any racer who starts in an earlier or later wave than their
official assigned start time without prior approval from
the Race Organisers will be Disqualified [DQ].
2 It is the racer’s responsibility to wear their timing chip
on an ankle at all times while racing. Failure to do so will
result in a ‘Did Not Start’ [DNS] leaderboard result.
3 Racers must avoid entering the Roxzone or run course
before their official start time, as doing so may trigger
their timing chip and result in an incorrect race time.

# The HYROX Elite 15 Season: Fitness Racing’s Biggest Stage
The HYROX Elite 15 Season is a high-stakes, global journey where the world’s top fitness athletes battle for a spot at the ultimate competition—the HYROX World Championships. With adrenaline-pumping races in iconic cities across the globe, the Elite 15 season is a relentless test of endurance, strength, and mental fortitude. Only the best will rise to claim their place on the world stage.

## The Majors: Battlegrounds for the Best

## The Majors: Battlegrounds for the Best

The Majors are where it all begins. In the 2025/26 season, four Major races will take place; these events are athletes’ first chance to secure a coveted spot at the World Championships.

Each Major hosts a Male and Female Elite 15 race, where only the top three finishers earn automatic qualification for the HYROX World Championships.

**The Majors season 25/26:**

- Hamburg, Germany
- Melbourne, Australia
- Phoenix, USA
- Warsaw, Poland

These Majors are hosted in some of the world’s most exciting cities, offering both athletes and fans an unforgettable experience as the competition heats up on the road to the World Championships.

**How Do You Qualify For a Major?**

An athlete who has set their sights on the professional racing circuit has two routes to qualify for a Major:

- **Automatic Qualification**: The winners of each Major and podium finishers from last year’s World Championships (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) automatically qualify for all Majors.
- **Time Qualification**: A dynamic ranking system, updated throughout the season, selects the remaining athletes based on the average of their two best Pro times over the past year. This means every race counts, and every second matters.

You can see the current qualification standings for the next upcoming Major. Before each Major, there is a cut-off date prior to the event when invites are extended. If an athlete chooses not to accept their invitation, that place rolls down to the next athlete—giving those on the fringe of qualification a potential chance to join the field.

The drama unfolds at every Major as athletes push their limits in head-to-head battles for victory, knowing only the fastest will earn their ticket to the World Championships in Stockholm 2026.

## The Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ)

For those who fall short at the Majors, there’s one last shot—the Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) in Barcelona. This is an open-field event where the final spots for the World Championships will be decided. It’s a high-pressure, all-out race where dreams are made or broken. The top finishers here will join the ranks of the elite at the pinnacle of the season.

## ELITE 15 World Championships

Everything builds to this. The HYROX World Championships of Fitness Racing, held in 2025 at Chicago’s Navy Pier, is the climax of the Elite 15 season. 15 men and 15 women will compete for the title of HYROX World Champion of Fitness Racing, the most coveted title in fitness sports.

Expect the unexpected in Chicago, where current champions Megan Jacoby (USA) and Alexander Roncevic (Austria) will defend their crowns in a race broadcast live to fans around the world. It’s a spectacle of human performance, where the finest athletes compete not just for victory, but for legacy.

The Elite 15 Season is the dream of many and the reality of few – but unique in its format the Elite 15 season.

With only a handful of spots at the World Championships and fierce competition at every turn, the path to Chicago promises to be electric, unpredictable, and unforgettable.

Will you be there to witness the next World Champions crowned?

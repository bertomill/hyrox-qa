5. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS
The highlight of each HYROX season is the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS.
Any participant in a regular HYROX event has the opportunity to qualify
for the annual HYROX WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS.
Qualification spots are limited to 3 per division across the season.
The top 3 athletes in each division, based on the fastest times of the entire
season, will be invited to compete at the HYROX WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS. Competitors will race within their respective divisions
to determine the Adaptive Division World Champion.
Adaptive Division winners are not eligible for prize money or the overall
title of "World Champion of Fitness Racing“.
HYROX reserves the right to hand out wildcards and invite other athletes
to the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS at its discretion
6. THE COMPETITION
HYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by one workout, repeated 8

times. In order to complete the entire HYROX race and receive a valid
finishing time, the participants must complete the runs and workouts in
the designated order (run, workout, run, workout, etc.) until they have
completed a total of 8 km running and 8 workouts.
Except for athletes with neurological impairments or short stature, who will complete 1 lap (approximately 350 meters)

between each workout.

the fast lane and slower athletes in the regular speed lane.

The head judge of each workout station is managed by the race director,
who oversees all sporting aspects of the competition and makes the final
decisions on all judging matters.

All decisions of the Race Director and event organisers are final.

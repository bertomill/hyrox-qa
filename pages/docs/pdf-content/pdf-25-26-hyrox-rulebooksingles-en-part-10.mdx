*Part 10 of 22 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookSingles_EN.pdf (44 pages total)*

9 MOVEMENT
STANDARDS,
DISTANCES AND
WEIGHTS
It is the responsibility of each racer to complete all
run segments and workout stations as prescribed,
in the correct sequence, and to clearly demonstrate
that all required movement standards are being met
throughout the race.
Any execution of a run or movement that deviates
from the prescribed standards, appears unusual
or uncommon, or appears to provide a competitive
advantage will not be recognised. Such actions may
result in either a no rep or a time penalty, depending
on the station.
Additionally, equipment and lane assignments for
each station will be determined by the Head Judge
and their team. Racers are not permitted to choose
their own equipment or lane under any circumstances.
1 Prior to starting, the monitor will be [re]set by a
Judge.
2 The racer must have both feet on the SkiErg
platform at all times during the exercise. Lifting
the feet during the execution of the exercise is
allowed. The racer’s heels are permitted to hang
over the edge of the SkiErg base but must not
come into contact with the floor.
9.1 SKIERG
DISTANCE:
1.000 METERS

HYROX EN SINGLE RULEBOOK_25/26

Note: The damper setting on the ergometer is preset to
resistance 6 for all divisions–this may be adjusted as many
times as desired by the racer.
3 After completing the required distance, the racer
must remain with both feet on the platform and
raise an arm to signal to a Judge that the required
distance has been completed.
4 The racer may only leave their SkiErg upon
receiving the Judge’s confirmation of completion.
1 If the racer’s feet move from the SkiErg base, this
will result in a formal warning.
2 A second infringement will result in a 15-second
penalty.
3 Each subsequent infringement will incur an
additional 15-second penalty–no further warnings
will be issued.
4 If the racer leaves before completing the 1,000
meters, they will receive a time penalty or be
disqualified, depending on the severity of the
violation.
SKIERG PENALTY PROTOCOL
1 Each racer will be assigned a sled lane by a
member of the judging team. It is mandatory that
the racer uses the assigned sled lane.
2 Both sled and racer must be completely behind
the white line prior to starting.
3 Both sled and racer must stay within their
designated lane and not interfere with a
neighbouring lane in any way.
4 The sled must always pass the 12.5m mark [end
of the lane] entirely before changing direction.
5 As soon as the racer completes 4 x 12.5m lanes
and the entire sled passes the line, the station is
complete.
6 If the racer completes less than four lanes, a
penalty of 3 minutes per missing lane will be
applied.
9.2 SLED PUSH
DISTANCE:
50 METERS

*Part 15 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

Depending on the venue, achieving 200 meters may
involve multiple laps. It is the racer’s responsibility
to familiarise themselves with the athlete map
and complete the required number of laps. It is the
racer’s responsibility to select the correct weight of
kettlebells appropriate for their division–see options
forweights/colours below.
1 The kettlebell Farmers Carry begins and ends
with the removal/return of the kettlebells from
the marked box next to the workout station start/
finish line.
2 The racer has to carry both kettlebells at all times
while they move.
3 Kettlebells must be carried with both arms
extended by the racer’s sides.
4 Putting down the kettlebells to rest is permitted
so long as the kettlebells do not move forward
when placing them on the ground.
5 During each Kettlebell transition between the
DTMs, the KBs must not be passed forward.
Sideways or backwards is permitted, never
forwards.
6 The resting DTM must walk behind the working
DTM at all times. It is not permitted to obstruct
other racers e.g. walking alongside the working
DTM. Doing so will be treated as an infringement.
7 The workout station is completed once the racer
carries the kettlebells across the finish line and
returns them to the correct box, ensuring that the
handles remain in the upright position.

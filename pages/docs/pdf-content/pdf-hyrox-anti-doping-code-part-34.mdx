If HYROX-World recovers prize money (if awarded) forfeited as a result of an anti-
doping rule violation shall take reasonable measures to allocate and distribute this
prize money to the Athletes who would have been entitled to it had the forfeiting
Athlete not competed.
10.12 [Left blank]
10.13 Commencement of Ineligibility Period
Where an Athlete is already serving a period of Ineligibility for an anti-doping rule
violation, any new period of Ineligibility shall commence on the first day after the
current period of Ineligibility has been served. Otherwise, except as provided below,
the period of Ineligibility shall start on the date of the final hearing decision providing
for Ineligibility or, if the hearing is waived or there is no hearing, on the date Ineligibility
is accepted or otherwise imposed.
10.13.1 Delays Not Attributable to the Athlete or other Person
Where there have been substantial delays in the hearing process or other aspects of
Doping Control, and the Athlete or other Person can establish that such delays are
not attributable to the Athlete or other Person, the body responsible for imposing the
sanction (see Article 12) may start the period of Ineligibility at an earlier date
commencing as early as the date of Sample collection or the date on which another
anti-doping rule violation last occurred. All competitive results achieved during the
period of Ineligibility, including retroactive Ineligibility, shall be Disqualified.
10.13.2 Credit for Provisional Suspension or Period of Ineligibility Served
10.13.2.1 If a Provisional Suspension is respected by the Athlete or other Person, then the
Athlete or other Person shall receive a credit for such period of Provisional
Suspension against any period of Ineligibility which may ultimately be imposed. If the
Athlete or other Person does not respect a Provisional Suspension, then the Athlete
or other Person shall receive no credit for any period of Provisional Suspension
served. If a period of Ineligibility is served pursuant to a decision that is subsequently
appealed, then the Athlete or other Person shall receive a credit for such period of
Ineligibility served against any period of Ineligibility which may ultimately be imposed
on appeal.
10.13.2.2 If an Athlete or other Person voluntarily accepts a Provisional Suspension in
writing from HYROX-World and thereafter respects the Provisional Suspension, the
Athlete or other Person shall receive a credit for such period of voluntary Provisional
Suspension against any period of Ineligibility which may ultimately be imposed. A
copy of the Athlete or other Personâ€™s voluntary acceptance of a Provisional
Suspension shall be provided promptly to each party entitled to receive notice of an
asserted anti-doping rule violation under Article 14.1.
10.13.2.3 No credit against a period of Ineligibility shall be given for any time period
before the effective date of the Provisional Suspension or voluntary Provisional
Suspension regardless of whether the Athlete elected not to compete or was
suspended by a team.
10.13.2.4 [Left blank]
10.14 Status during Ineligibility or Provisional Suspension
10.14.1 Prohibition against Participation during Ineligibility or Provisional Suspension

# 25 26 HYROX RulebookSingles EN - Part 12 of 22

*Part 12 of 22 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookSingles_EN.pdf (44 pages total)*

1 The racer must start by completing a burpee.
2 The first burpee of each section starts with both
hands placed on the ground/contrasting coloured
tape behind the white start–line with the racer’s
chest on the ground [see Fig 004].
9.4 BURPEE BROAD JUMP
DISTANCE:
80 METERS
a In this context, ‘chest on the ground’ is defined
as the nipple line making clear contact with
the ground.
a The 30 cm measures from the base of the
racer’s palms where their hands meet their
wrists [see Fig 007].
b Once the hands are placed on the ground,
they cannot be moved forward.
3 The racer may then jump or step out of the burpee
before broad jumping forward over the start
line. During all broad jumps, both feet must be
parallel for taking off and landing [see Fig 005].
No staggered foot positions, additional steps or
shuffles are permitted at any time.
4 Racers are permitted to use a knee when coming
out of the bottom of the burpee position.
5 When jumping or stepping out of any burpee,
the feet cannot go beyond the racer’s fingertips
[overstepping] [see Fig 006].
6 When starting all subsequent burpees, the racer’s
hands must be placed no more than 30 cm’s
forward of their toes.

7 The racer may then jump or step backwards into
the burpee position. In the bottom of all burpees,
the racer’s chest must clearly touch the ground.
8 If grid lanes are in place, they are there as a guide
only - it is not mandatory to stay in the same lane
i.e. a faster racer can cross lanes to overtake a
slower racer.
9 The length of each broad jump is up to the racer.
10 Where turning points are used at the end of each
section, racers are not required to perform the
movement around them. However, the racer must
jump across every white start/finish line with
both feet fully crossing the line at the end of the
section before turning. Each new section must
begin from the designated start line position–
chest on the ground with hands placed behind
the white line [see Fig 008].

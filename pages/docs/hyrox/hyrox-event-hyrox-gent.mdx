Charity Information

HYROX is all about pushing limits—now, you can race for a cause that matters. In partnership with High Impact Athletes (HIA), we’re launching Race for Impact, a chance to fundraise for global charities while competing.

You’ll have the chance to Race for Impact by choosing the Charity Ticket option when you sign up for your next HYROX event. From there, you’ll create your fundraising platform via HIA and choose from one of four important cause areas to focus your efforts on:

- Global Health
- Climate Solutions
- Mental Health
- Women’s Empowerment

The minimum fundraising requirement is €500, and your mission is simple: rally support from your network to help meet that goal before race day. If your target isn’t reached, you’ll be required to cover the remaining amount in order to compete. But don’t worry—High Impact Athletes will be with you every step of the way. Any questions left? Feel free to reach out via [help@raceforimpact.com](mailto:help@raceforimpact.com)

**UK & Northern Ireland Charity Partner remains McMillan**

Participants in the UK and Northern Ireland can race for Macmillan Cancer Support, aiding their vital work in cancer care.

**Join the Impact Community**

By racing, you’ll be part of a community making a difference. Choose your cause, set your goal, and get started. Together, we can create lasting change.

Let’s Race for Impact and make a difference!

# Judges Tutorials
Thanks for being a part of the Race Crew – yours is an important role that helps to protect the integrity of the sport and ensure that everything goes smoothly on race day.

These short tutorials are designed to supplement your live online and in-person training. They explain the flow of each workstation, and how the Judging team should be organised.

We suggest you start by watching the tutorial for the Workstation you are assigned to.

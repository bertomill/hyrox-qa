# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 10 of 23

*Part 10 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

The running splits are always around 1,000 meters;
depending on the venue, this may be split between
1-5 running laps.
In some cases, the first/last running lap may be less
than 1,000 meters due to the location of the start
tunnel. In these cases, these missing meters will be
balanced out during the last lap.
On the run course, there is a line dividing the running
course into two zones: Fast Lane [smaller, on the
inside line] and Running Lane [larger, on the outside
line]. Racers running at a 4/km pace or faster are
required to use the Fast Lane, while other racers
should stay in the Running Lane. In the event that
HYROX crew are directing the Fast Lane, all racers
must comply with
their instructions.
A Judging Team will be responsible for ensuring all
racers complete the in the correct and safe manner.
The Judges do this in coordination with the Head
Judge of the respective station.
The Head Judge of each station is managed by the
Race Directors, who oversee all sporting aspects of
the race and make the final decisions on all judging
matters.
All decisions of the Lead Race Director are final.
8.4 JUDGING TEAMS

WEIGHTS
It is the responsibility of each racer to complete all
run segments and workout stations as prescribed,
in the correct sequence, and to clearly demonstrate
that all required movement standards are being met
throughout the race.
Any execution of a run or movement that deviates
from the prescribed standards, appears unusual
or uncommon, or appears to provide a competitive
advantage will not be recognised. Such actions may
result in either a no rep or a time penalty, depending
on the station.
Additionally, equipment and lane assignments for
each station will be determined by the Head Judge
and their team. Racers are not permitted to choose
their own equipment or lane under any circumstances.

platform at all times during the exercise. Lifting
the feet during the execution of the exercise is

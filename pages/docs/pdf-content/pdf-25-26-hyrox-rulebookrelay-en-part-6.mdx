# 25 26 HYROX RulebookRelay EN - Part 6 of 18

*Part 6 of 18 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookRelay_EN.pdf (35 pages total)*

The Transition Zone [TZ] is where the RM exchange
takes place. The RM who is up next is only allowed
to enter shortly before the exchange. No loitering is
allowed in this zone. It is the responsibility of each
RELAY Team to make sure their RTMs get into the TZ
on time. Once a RM has finished their workout station,
they must run into the TZ to meet with the RM who is
up next.
IMPORTANT: If a RM performs 2 runs and workout
stations [i.e. back to back], they need to run through
the TZ after each workout to ensure the timing chip is
‘seen’. Not doing so will result in an automatic penalty.
The exchange must follow this protocol:
When RM 1 finishes their run and workout station,
they enter the TZ. They then high-five RM 2 who is
waiting for them. Once the transition occurs, RM2
starts their run and RM 1 promptly exits the TZ to
avoid congestion.
A Judging Team will be responsible for ensuring all
racers complete the in the correct and safe manner.
The Judges do this in coordination with the Head
Judge of the respective station.
The Head Judge of each station is managed by the
Race Directors, who oversee all sporting aspects of
the race and make the final decisions on all judging
matters.
All decisions of the Lead Race Director are final.

STANDARDS,
DISTANCES AND
WEIGHTS
It is the responsibility of each racer to complete all
run segments and workout stations as prescribed,
in the correct sequence, and to clearly demonstrate
that all required movement standards are being met
throughout the race.
Any execution of a run or movement that deviates
from the prescribed standards, appears unusual
or uncommon, or appears to provide a competitive
advantage will not be recognised. Such actions may
result in either a no rep or a time penalty, depending
on the station.
Additionally, equipment and lane assignments for
each station will be determined by the Head Judge
and their team. Racers are not permitted to choose
their own equipment or lane under any circumstances.
1 Prior to starting, the monitor will be [re]set by a
Judge.
2 The racer must have both feet on the SkiErg
platform at all times during the exercise. Lifting
the feet during the execution of the exercise is
allowed. The racer’s heels are permitted to hang
over the edge of the SkiErg base but must not
come into contact with the floor.

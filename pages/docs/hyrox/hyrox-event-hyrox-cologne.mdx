Flex-Add On Guidelines \| Flex Add-On vs. No Flex Add-On

For the 2025/26 HYROX season, we’ve introduced the Flex Add-On to give athletes more flexibility and peace of mind in case of unexpected changes. It allows you to request a refund or make certain changes to your ticket up to 1 day before the race.

If you’re confident you’ll attend and want a more cost-effective option, you can choose a ticket without the Flex Add-On.

Here’s what you need to know when purchasing with or without the Flex Add-On:

**Singles Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- Full Refund\*: Available up to 7 days before the event.
- 50% Refund\*: Available up to 1 day before the event.
- Name Changes: Not available.

**Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- Full Refund\*: Available up to 7 days before the event.
- 50% Refund\*: Available up to 1 day before the event.
- 1 Name Change: Allowed up to 1 day before the event via your HYROX Account.

**Singles/Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + No Flex**

- No Flexibility: This option does not allow any changes after purchase. This includes no ticket modifications, name changes, or refunds.

\*All refunds exclude the Flex Fee and Service Fee and must be requested via your [HYROX Account](https://da.hyrox.com/). If you don’t have a HYROX account, please create one using the email address you used to purchase your ticket. You can also manage your ticket via the confirmation page, which you can find through your ticket confirmation email (subject: Order successful – Next step: Activate ticket(s))

Important: For the 2025/26 season, we will no longer offer transfers to other events or division changes. Please ensure you select your ticket carefully, as changes to ticket types cannot be made once your booking is confirmed. Additionally, the Flex Add-On cannot be added after the initial purchase.

**Point of Personalisation**

You will be required to personalise your ticket during the booking process. Before completing your purchase, please provide the following information for each Athlete Ticket:

First & Last Name \| Email \| DOB \| Nationality

Please ensure all athlete details are entered correctly during checkout (especially for doubles and relays). If incorrect information is entered, no changes can be made online or on-site unless the Flex Add-On was purchased. With the Flex Add-On, only one change is allowed (only for doubles or relays).

Charity Information

HYROX is all about pushing limits—now, you can race for a cause that matters. In partnership with High Impact Athletes (HIA), we’re launching Race for Impact, a chance to fundraise for global charities while competing.

You’ll have the chance to Race for Impact by choosing the Charity Ticket option when you sign up for your next HYROX event. From there, you’ll create your fundraising platform via HIA and choose from one of four important cause areas to focus your efforts on:

- Global Health
- Climate Solutions
- Mental Health
- Women’s Empowerment

The minimum fundraising requirement is €300 (Singles), €500 (Doubles Teams), €800 (Relay Teams), and your mission is simple: rally support from your network to help meet that goal before race day.

The charity ticket is discounted to encourage as many people as possible to fundraise. To prevent misuse, anyone who doesn’t meet the minimum goal will be blacklisted and won’t be able to purchase charity tickets in the future.

But don’t worry—High Impact Athletes will be with you every step of the way to help you archive the target!

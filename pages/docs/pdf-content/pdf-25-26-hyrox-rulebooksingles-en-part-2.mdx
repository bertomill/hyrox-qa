# 25 26 HYROX RulebookSingles EN - Part 2 of 22

*Part 2 of 22 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookSingles_EN.pdf (44 pages total)*

1 CONCEPT
HYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness
competition, is based on an idea by co-founder
Christian Toetzke and involves a combination of
running and functional movements. The race was
designed by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.
HYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station,
repeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire
HYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the
racers must complete the runs and stations in the
specific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2,
workout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a
total of 8 km running and 8 stations.
Whilst the repetition range and/or weights differ
between the divisions, the running distance remains
the same across all divisions: each racer must run 1
km before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.
The results and ranking system are based on the
fastest time in each respective division. Results
are sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In
addition to the overall fastest men’s and women’s
times, results are also ranked in age groups [see
below], also sorted from the fastest to the slowest
time.

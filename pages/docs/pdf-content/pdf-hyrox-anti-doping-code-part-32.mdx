addition, an anti-doping rule violation sanctioned under Article 10.2.4.1 shall not be
considered a violation for purposes of Article 10.9.
10.9.3 Additional Rules for Certain Potential Multiple Violations
10.9.3.1 For purposes of imposing sanctions under Article 10.9, except as provided in Articles
10.9.3.2 and 10.9.3.3, an anti-doping rule violation will only be considered a second
violation if HYROX-World can establish that the Athlete or other Person committed
the additional anti-doping rule violation after the Athlete or other Person received
notice pursuant to Article 7, or after HYROX-World made reasonable efforts to give
notice of the first anti-doping rule violation. If HYROX-World cannot establish this, the
violations shall be considered together as one single first violation, and the sanction
imposed shall be based on the violation that carries the more severe sanction,
including the application of Aggravating Circumstances. Results in all Competitions
dating back to the earlier anti-doping rule violation will be Disqualified as provided in
Article 10.10.
10.9.3.2 If HYROX-World establishes that an Athlete or other Person committed an additional
anti-doping rule violation prior to notification, and that the additional violation
occurred 12 months or more before or after the first-noticed violation, then the period
of Ineligibility for the additional violation shall be calculated as if the additional
violation were a stand-alone first violation and this period of Ineligibility is served
consecutively, rather than concurrently, with the period of Ineligibility imposed for the
earlier-noticed violation. Where this Article 10.9.3.2 applies, the violations taken
together shall constitute a single violation for purposes of Article 10.9.1.
10.9.3.3 If HYROX-World establishes that an Athlete or other Person committed a violation of
Article 2.5 in connection with the Doping Control process for an underlying asserted
anti-doping rule violation, the violation of Article 2.5 shall be treated as a stand-alone
first violation and the period of Ineligibility for such violation shall be served
consecutively, rather than concurrently, with the period of Ineligibility, if any, imposed
for the underlying anti-doping rule violation. Where this Article 10.9.3.3 is applied, the
violations taken together shall constitute a single violation for purposes of Article
10.9.1.
10.9.3.4 If HYROX-World establishes that a Person has committed a second or third anti-
doping rule violation during a period of Ineligibility, the periods of Ineligibility for the
multiple violations shall run consecutively, rather than concurrently.
10.9.4 Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations during Ten-Year Period
For purposes of Article 10.9, each anti-doping rule violation must take place within
the same ten-year period in order to be considered multiple violations.
10.10 Disqualification of Results in Competitions Subsequent to Sample Collection or
Commission of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation
In addition to the automatic Disqualification of the results in the Competition which
produced the positive Sample under Article 9, all other competitive results of the
Athlete obtained from the date a positive Sample was collected (whether In-
Competition or Out-of-Competition), or other anti- doping rule violation occurred,
through the commencement of any Provisional Suspension or Ineligibility period,
shall, unless fairness requires otherwise, be Disqualified with all of the resulting
Consequences including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes.
10.11 Forfeited Prize Money

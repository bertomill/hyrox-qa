# HYROX Anti Doping Code - Part 2 of 43

*Part 2 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

HYROX-ADC, page 2 of 27
INTRODUCTORY NOTES
The HYROX-ADC is based on the provisions of the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC 2021) of
the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Anti-Doping Code of the German National
Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) which is in turn based on the WADC (NADC 2021). However, the
HYROX-ADC (as regards the content and its structure) is amended as necessary to take
account of the fact that HYROX-World represents a private sports organizer which is not part
of the pyramidal sports federation structure and thus not a signatory within the meaning of
the WADC. HYROX-World is therefore responsible for Pre-/Adjudication as well as Results
Management and Disciplinary Proceedings under this HYROX-ADC (hereinafter also referred
to as “Code”).
If and to the extent relevant to the application of this Code, the definitions of the WADC 2021
(see APPENDIX 1, p. 163 et seq.) form an integral part of the HYROX-ADC. However, where
terms are defined in this Code and the definition differs from those of the WADC, the
provisions of this Code shall prevail.
As far as the WADC 2021 and NADC 2021 (in this context largely identical in terms of content)
contain comments on provisions, HYROX-World may refer to these comments in the
interpretation and application of this Code.

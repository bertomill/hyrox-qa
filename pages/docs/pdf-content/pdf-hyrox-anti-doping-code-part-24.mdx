HYROX-ADC, page 14 of 27
be considered a particularly serious violation and, if committed by Athlete Support
Personnel for violations other than for Specified Substances, shall result in lifetime
Ineligibility for Athlete Support Personnel. In addition, significant violations of Article
2.7 or 2.8 which may also violate non-sporting laws and regulations, shall be reported
to the competent administrative, professional or judicial authorities.
10.3.4 For violations of Article 2.9, the period of Ineligibility imposed shall be a minimum of
one year, up to lifetime Ineligibility, depending on the seriousness of the violation.
10.3.5 For violations of Article 2.10, the period of Ineligibility shall be two years, subject to
reduction down to a minimum of six months, depending on the Athlete or other
Person’s degree of Fault and other circumstances of the case.
10.3.6 For violations of Article 2.11, the period of Ineligibility shall be a minimum of one year,
up to lifetime Ineligibility, depending on the seriousness of the violation by the Athlete
or other Person.
10.4 Aggravating Circumstances which may Increase the Period of Ineligibility
If HYROX-World establishes in an individual case involving an anti- doping rule
violation other than violations under Article 2.7 (Trafficking or Attempted Trafficking),
2.8 (Administration or Attempted Administration), 2.9 (Complicity) or 2.11 (Acts by an
Athlete or Other Person to Discourage or Retaliate Against Reporting) that
Aggravating Circumstances are present which justify the imposition of a period of
Ineligibility greater than the standard sanction, then the period of Ineligibility
otherwise applicable shall be increased by an additional period of Ineligibility of up to
two years depending on the seriousness of the violation and the nature of the
Aggravating Circumstances, unless the Athlete or other Person can establish that he
or she did not knowingly commit the anti-doping rule violation.
[Comment by HYROX-World: If this HYROX-ADC specifies a sanction range
(“minimum ... and maximum ...”), all circumstances (aggravating or mitigating) must
first be appropriately assessed and considered when determining the standard
sanction. If and to the extent that the stipulated maximum is not considered
sufficient to adequately take into account aggravating circumstances in the
individual case, the period of Ineligibility may be increased by a maximum of two
years.]
10.5 Elimination of the Period of Ineligibility where there is No Fault or Negligence
If an Athlete or other Person establishes in an individual case that he or she bears No
Fault or Negligence, then the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility shall be
eliminated.
10.6 Reduction of the Period of Ineligibility based on No Significant Fault or Negligence
10.6.1 Reduction of Sanctions in Particular Circumstances for Violations of Article 2.1, 2.2 or
2.6.
Note: The following reductions are mutually exclusive and not cumulative.
10.6.1.1 Specified Substances or Specified Methods
Where the anti-doping rule violation involves a Specified Substance (other than a
Substance of Abuse) or Specified Method, and the Athlete or other Person can
establish No Significant Fault or Negligence, then the period of Ineligibility shall be,
at a minimum, a reprimand and no period of Ineligibility, and at a maximum, two years
of Ineligibility, depending on the Athlete’s or other Person’s degree of Fault.

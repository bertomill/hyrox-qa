# HYROX Anti Doping Code - Part 9 of 43

*Part 9 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

4.1 Publication and Revision of the Prohibited List
Prohibited List within the meaning of the HYROX-ADC means the Prohibited List as
published by WADA as an International Standard as often as necessary, but at least
once a year. Unless provided otherwise in the Prohibited List and/or a revision, the
Prohibited List and its revisions shall enter into effect three months after publication
by WADA, without requiring further measures. HYROX-World will provide its athletes
with the publication date in due time. The Prohibited List is part of this Code as
amended from time to time. The current version of the Prohibited List can be viewed
on the WADA homepage at wada-ama.org/prohibited-list. Moreover, HYROX-World
will make available a digital copy of the Prohibited List upon request by an Athlete.
4.2 Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods listed in the Prohibited List
4.2.1 Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods
The Prohibited List lists those Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods that
are forbidden as doping at all times (Out-of-Competition and In-Competition)
because of their potential to increase performance or because of their masking
potential, as well as those substances and methods that are only prohibited In-
Competition. WADA may extend the Prohibited List for specific types of sport.
Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods can be included in the Prohibited List
as a general category or with a special reference to a specific substance or a specific
method.
4.2.2 Specified Substances or Specified Methods
For the purposes of applying Article 10, all Prohibited Substances shall be Specified
Substances except as identified on the Prohibited List. No Prohibited Method shall
be a Specified Method unless it is specifically identified as a Specified Method on the
Prohibited List.
4.2.3 Substance of Abuse
For the purposes of applying Article 10, Substances of Abuse shall include those
Prohibited Substances which are specifically identified as Substances of Abuse on
the Prohibited List because they are frequently abused in society outside of the
context of sport.
4.3 WADA’s determination of the Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods that will
be included on the Prohibited List, the classification of substances into categories on
the Prohibited List, the classification of a substance as prohibited at all times or In-
Competition only, the classification of a substance or method as a Specified
Substance, Specified Method or Substance of Abuse is final and shall not be subject
to any challenge by an Athlete or other Person including, but not limited to, any
challenge based on an argument that the substance or method was not a masking
agent or did not have the potential to enhance performance, represent a health risk
or violate the spirit of sport.

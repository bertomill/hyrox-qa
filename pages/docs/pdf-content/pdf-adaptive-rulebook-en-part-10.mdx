*Part 10 of 14 from ADAPTIVE_RULEBOOK_EN.pdf (24 pages total)*

8.8 Wall Balls
•With every throw the ball must strike the designated target.
•Before the athlete starts with the Wall Balls, the ball must be picked up
from the ground and the athlete has to stand in the upright position
with hips and knees extended before he/she initiates the movement.
•The athlete then squats (while holding the ball with both hands) and
throws the ball (with both hands) to the target when standing up. This is
counted as one repetition. After the ball touches the target, the athlete
catches the ball and initiates the movement again.
•If the athlete does not catch the ball, he/she must first pick up the ball
from the ground and stand in the upright position with hips and knees
extended before he/she initiates the movement.
•At the bottom position of the squat, the athlete’s hips must descend
lower than his/her knees (below 90°).
•If necessary, the referee may use a box that to make sure the athlete’s
squat is low enough.
•If necessary the referee can assist in handing over the ball in order to
start the movement
•If the athlete violates any of the above mentioned points, the repetition
becomes invalid.

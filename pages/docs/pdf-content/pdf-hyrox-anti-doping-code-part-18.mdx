# HYROX Anti Doping Code - Part 18 of 43

*Part 18 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

HYROX-ADC, page 11 of 27
For anti-doping rule violations not included in Article 7.4.1, HYROX-World may impose
a Provisional Suspension before analysis of the Athleteâ€™s B-Sample or before
completion of any Hearing Proceedings in accordance with Article 12.
7.4.3 Option of the Provisional Hearing
Notwithstanding Articles 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, a Provisional Suspension may, however, only
be imposed if the Athlete or other Person is given the opportunity for a Provisional
Hearing either before imposing the Provisional Suspension or in a timely manner after
imposing the Provisional Suspension.
7.4.4. Voluntary acceptance of a Provisional Suspension
Athletes may voluntarily accept a Provisional Suspension if this is done within 10 days
of receipt of the analysis report of the B-Sample (or waiver of the B-Sample) or within
10 days of receipt of notification on the other potential anti-doping rule violations, or.
Other Persons may, at their own initiation, voluntarily accept a Provisional
Suspension if this is done within 10 days of receipt of the notification concerning the
potential anti-doping rule violation. Voluntary acceptance renders Provisional
Suspension effective in full, upon which it shall be treated as if it had been imposed
in accordance with Articles 7.4.1 or 7.4.2. After the Athlete or the other Person has
voluntarily accepted the Provisional Suspension, they can revoke their acceptance at
any time. In that case, however, the time passed previously during the Provisional
Suspension shall not be off set against the total duration.
7.4.5 Revocation of the provisional suspension if the B-Sample is negative
If an Adverse Analytical Finding of the A-Sample leads to the imposition of a
Provisional Suspension and analysis of the B-Sample requested by the Athlete or
HYROX-World does not confirm the analysis result, the Provisional Suspension must
be revoked without delay. In cases where the Athlete was declared ineligible for a
HYROX event and the analysis result from the A-Sample is not confirmed by
subsequent analysis of the B-Sample, the Athlete may continue participation in the
event if re-entry is still possible without any further impairment of the Event.
7.5 [Left blank]
7.6 Notification of Results Management Decisions
Athletes and other Persons shall be notified of Results Management decisions as
provided in Article 14 and the International Standard for Results Management.
7.7 Retirement from Sport
If an Athlete or other Person retires while a Results Management process is underway
(the same applies in case the retirement takes place before any Results Management
process has begun), the authority of HYROX-World to initiate or complete its Results
Management remains unaffected.

ARTICLE 8 ANALYSIS OF THE B-SAMPLE

The prerequisites for analysis of the B-Sample follow the International Standard for
Laboratories and the International Standard for Results Management.

ARTICLE 9 AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL RESULTS

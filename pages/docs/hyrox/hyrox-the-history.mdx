## Mass Participation

Over 98% of our athletes complete their HYROX race. With no finishing time restriction, and no qualification required to enter, HYROX welcomes every participant with open arms.

It is a race to run at your own pace, with the continuous support of friends, family and fellow participants.

Not only that, but the structure of HYROX eliminates the generic fear of ‘coming last’. Every HYROX race has start waves of all ages happening every 10 minutes throughout the entire day, working through each division. Put simply, this means that a 3-hour athlete can cross the finish line at the very same time as a sub-60 athlete!

## Founders

Created by one of the most experienced and successful mass participation race event organisers in the world, Christian Toetzke, together with x3 Olympic Medallist and World Champion, Moritz Furste, HYROX has experienced remarkable growth in Europe and the US, with some events seeing over 8,000 participants and 10,000 spectators – making this sport the world’s largest mass participation Fitness Race.

## Global Footprint

Since its launch in Hamburg, Germany in 2017, HYROX has seen exponential growth, with over 90,000 athletes in the 22/23 Season alone.

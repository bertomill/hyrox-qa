HYROX-ADC, page 4 of 27
2.10.1 Association by an Athlete or other Person subject to the authority of HYROX-World or
an Anti-Doping Organization within the meaning of the WADC in a professional or
sport-related capacity with any Athlete Support Person who is serving a period of
Ineligibility, has been convicted or found in a criminal, disciplinary or professional
proceeding to have engaged in conduct which would have constituted a violation of
anti-doping rules if WADC/NADC compliant rules had been applicable to such Person,
or is serving as a front or intermediary for an individual described above.
2.10.2 To establish a violation of Article 2.10, HYROX-World or the Anti-Doping Organization
within the meaning of the WADC must establish that the Athlete or other Person knew
of the Athlete Support Person’s disqualifying status. The burden shall be on the
Athlete or other Person to establish that any association with an Athlete Support
Person described in Article 2.10.1 is not in a professional or sport-related capacity
and/or that such association could not have been reasonably avoided. In case
HYROX-World becomes aware of Athlete Support Personnel who meet the criteria
described above, HYROX-World shall be entitled, but not obliged, to submit any such
information to WADA.
2.11 Acts by an Athlete or Other Person to Discourage or Retaliate Against Reporting
Where such conduct does not otherwise constitute a violation of Article 2.5: Any act
which threatens or seeks to intimidate another Person with the intent of discouraging
the Person from the good-faith reporting of information that relates to an alleged
anti-doping rule violation or alleged non-compliance with this Code to HYROX-World,
WADA, an Anti-Doping Organization within the meaning of the WADC, a law
enforcement, regulatory or professional disciplinary body, hearing body or Person
conducting an investigation for HYROX-World, WADA or an Anti-Doping Organization
within the meaning of the WADC. The aforementioned applies accordingly to
retaliation, whereby for the purposes of Article 2.11, retaliation, threatening and
intimidation include an act taken against such Person either because the act lacks a
good faith basis or is a disproportionate response.

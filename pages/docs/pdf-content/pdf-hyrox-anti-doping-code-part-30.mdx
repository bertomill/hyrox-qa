HYROX-ADC, page 17 of 27
in the asserted period of Ineligibility under this Article 10.8.1, no further reduction in
the asserted period of Ineligibility shall be allowed under any other Article. If the
asserted period of Ineligibility is a lifetime, it must not be reduced to less than five
years.
10.8.2 Case Resolution Agreement
Where the Athlete or other Person admits an anti-doping rule violation after being
confronted with the anti-doping rule violation by HYROX-World and agrees to
Consequences acceptable to HYROX-World, at its sole discretion, then: (1) the Athlete
or other Person may receive a reduction in the period of Ineligibility based on an
assessment by HYROX-World the application of Articles 10.1 through 10.7 to the
asserted anti-doping rule violation, the seriousness of the violation, the Athlete or
other Person’s degree of Fault and how promptly the Athlete or other Person admitted
the violation; and (2) the period of Ineligibility may start as early as the date of Sample
collection or the date on which another anti-doping rule violation last occurred. In
each case, however, where this Article is applied, the Athlete or other Person shall
serve at least one-third of the agreed-upon period of Ineligibility going forward from
the earlier of the date the Athlete or other Person accepted the imposition of a
sanction or a Provisional Suspension which was subsequently respected by the
Athlete or other Person.
The decision by HYROX-World to enter or not enter into a case resolution agreement,
and the amount of the reduction to, and the starting date of the period of Ineligibility,
are not matters for determination or review by a hearing body and are not subject to
appeal under Article 13. If so requested by an Athlete or other Person who seeks to
enter into a case resolution agreement under this Article, HYROX-World shall allow
the Athlete or other Person to discuss an admission of the anti-doping rule violation
with it subject to a Without Prejudice Agreement.
10.9 Multiple Violations
10.9.1 Second or Third Anti-Doping Rule Violation
10.9.1.1 For an Athlete or other Person’s second anti-doping rule violation, the period of
Ineligibility shall be the greater of: (a) a six-month period of Ineligibility; or (b) a period
of Ineligibility in the range between: (1) the sum of the period of Ineligibility imposed
for the first anti-doping rule violation plus the period of Ineligibility otherwise
applicable to the second anti-doping rule violation treated as if it were a first violation,
and (2) twice the period of Ineligibility otherwise applicable to the second anti-doping
rule violation treated as if it were a first violation. The period of Ineligibility within this
range shall be determined based on the entirety of the circumstances and the Athlete
or other Person’s degree of Fault with respect to the second violation.
10.9.1.2 A third anti-doping rule violation will always result in a lifetime period of Ineligibility,
except if the third violation fulfills the condition for elimination or reduction of the
period of Ineligibility under Article 10.5 or 10.6 or involves a violation of Article 2.4. In
these particular cases, the period of Ineligibility shall be from eight years to lifetime
Ineligibility.
10.9.3.1 The period of Ineligibility established in Articles 10.9.1.1 and 10.9.1.2 may then be further
reduced by the application of Article 10.7.
10.9.2 An anti-doping rule violation for which an Athlete or other Person has established No
Fault or Negligence shall not be considered a violation for purposes of Article 10.9. In

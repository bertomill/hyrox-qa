4.4 Therapeutic Use Exemptions
4.4.1 The presence of a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers, and/or the use
or Attempted Use of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method, Possession of a
Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method, or the Administration or Attempt of
Administration of a Prohibited Substance or a Prohibited Method shall not be
considered an anti-doping rule violation if it is consistent with the provisions of a
Therapeutic Use Exemption granted in accordance with the specifications of the
International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions.
4.4.2. Athletes shall apply to HYROX-World for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE), as soon
as possible – save where Articles 4.1 or 4.3 of the International Standard for
Therapeutic Use Exemptions apply. The TUE application form as drafted by WADA is
available on the WADA homepage at wada-ama.org/tue-application-form. Moreover,
HYROX-World will provide the Athletes with its own application form as printable
version as well as in physical form upon request by the Athlete in text form (§ 126b
German Civil Code – Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB). Rules on the procedure for
granting of Therapeutic Use Exemptions shall be provided by Article 4.4 WADC, the
International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (see wada-ama.org/tue).
4.4.3 Where the Athlete already has a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) granted by their
respective National Anti-Doping Organization or an International Federation for the
substance or method in question, if that TUE meets the criteria set out in the
International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, then HYROX-World shall be
entitled to decide on the recognition of the TUE in its discretion. If HYROX-World
considers that the TUE does not meet those criteria and so refuses to recognize it, it
must notify the Athlete promptly, with reasons. However, the decision to refuse the
recognition shall be final and not legally contestable.
4.4.4 [Left blank]
4.5 Monitoring Program
WADA, in consultation with Signatories and governments, shall establish a
monitoring program regarding substances which are not on the Prohibited List, but
which WADA wishes to monitor in order to detect potential patterns of misuse in
sport. In addition, WADA may include in the monitoring program substances that are
on the Prohibited List, but which are to be monitored under certain circumstances –
e.g., Out-of-Competition Use of some substances prohibited In-Competition only or
the combined Use of multiple substances at low doses (“stacking”) – in order to
establish prevalence of Use or to be able to implement adequate decisions in regards
to their analysis by laboratories or their status within the Prohibited List. The reported
Use or detected presence of a monitored substance shall, however, not constitute an
anti-doping rule violation.

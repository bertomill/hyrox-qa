## World Championships

The HYROX World Championships are the pinnacle of each HYROX season, where the fastest racers from around the world come together to battle it out for the highly sought after title of ‘Age Group World Champion’.

The qualification process for the World Championships is simple.

Racers can qualify at any of the global HYROX races by achieving one of the top placings in their respective age group and division. Please note that qualification is only possible for athletes who compete in the Pro Division (except for 60+ Athletes, Doubles Mixed Division and all athletes who qualify at a Regional Championship). The number of qualifying spots available at each race is dependent on the total number of participants at the same.

If an athlete who has already qualified & registered for the World Championships qualifies again at another race in the same division, this qualification place will automatically be offered to the next ranking athlete in the roll-down. It is possible to qualify for the same World Championships in both the Pro Singles and Pro Doubles Divisions. Each qualification is treated independently, provided all criteria are met in each division.

Doubles Athletes must compete at the World Championships with the same partner they qualified with. Team substitutions are not permitted.

All qualified athletes will be notified of the World Championship qualification via email, and will have 72 hours to secure their spot. If they do not secure their spot within this time-frame, their qualification will be offered to the next athlete in the roll-down.

## HYROX Elite 15 Singles and Doubles World Championships

## HYROX Elite 15 Singles and Doubles World Championships

### Get ready for the most exciting evolution of the HYROX Elite 15 Competition!!

Building on the success of the established ELITE-15 Singles category — where the world’s top individual athletes compete at the highest level — the 24/25 Season introduced a thrilling new dimension: the **Pro Doubles Elite 15**.

This new format brings the fastest, most intense form of HYROX racing to the global stage, allowing elite doubles teams from around the world to battle for the title of Elite 15 Pro Doubles World Champions at this year’s World Championship event.

### How to Qualify for the Pro Doubles Elite 15 World Championship & Elite 15 World Championships

The **Pro Doubles Elite 15 World Championship** will feature the world’s top male and female doubles teams, while the **Elite 15 Singles World Championship** will continue to showcase the best individual HYROX athletes.

To qualify for either World Championship, athletes must meet the following criteria:

**Qualification Rules**

- **Top 3 podium finishers** (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) at each of the listed **Major Events** will qualify directly for either the **Pro Doubles Elite 15** or the **Elite 15 Singles** races, depending on the category they raced in, at the World Championships.
- The pairs of male and female racers who achieve Podium place 1 of each Regional Championship become directly qualified for the Double Elite 15 race at the World Championships.

This qualification pathway ensures that only the most elite athletes – both individuals and doubles teams – earn a spot to compete for the ultimate titles at the World Championship.

- **Hamburg Major** 03-05.10.25
- **Melbourne Major** 11-14.12.2025
- **Phoenix Major** 29-01.02.26
- **Washington DC – Americas Regional Championships** 07-08.03.26

**Important Notes**

- **No Mixed Doubles Category**

The official Elite Doubles Division currently includes only Male and Female categories. Mixed-gender teams are not eligible for qualification or ranking. However, HYROX reserves the right to introduce a Pro Mixed Doubles exhibition race at select events or championships.
- **Same Partner Rule**

Doubles Athletes must compete at the World Championships with the same partner they qualified with. Team substitutions are not permitted under any circumstances.
- **One Qualification per Athlete**

Your qualification is tied to the original athlete pairing from your qualifying Doubles race result. You cannot qualify multiple times with different teammates. If your original Doubles team is unable to compete, the qualification does not automatically transfer to another teammate combination from a later race.

### A Pinnacle Moment for HYROX Elite Competition

The Doubles category has become the most popular format in HYROX races worldwide, with over 50% of competitors choosing to race as a team. Since the launch of the **Pro Doubles category** in January 2024, it has seen explosive growth, with thousands of athletes taking part.

Now, due to overwhelming demand, the **Pro Doubles Elite 15 World Championship** gives this exciting format its own spotlight moment in the HYROX season — standing proudly alongside the long-established and prestigious **Elite 15 Singles World Championship**, which continues to showcase the top individual athletes in the sport.

Together, these two elite categories represent the highest level of HYROX competition — whether you race alone or as part of a team.

## Become a America, APAC or EMEA Champion

The HYROX Open Championships are compromised of two highly competitive races in Europe and the United States. These unique races give our racers the opportunity to become the European/US Champion of their Age Group and represent their country whilst doing so.

The HYROX Open Championships are composed of three highly competitive races in Europe, APAC and the United States. These unique races give our racers the opportunity to become the European, APAC or US Champion of their Age Group and represent their country whilst doing so.

Unlike the World Championships, the three Open Championships do not require qualification to enter. All our athletes from the respective region\* are able to sign up!

Also unlike the World Championships, all racers will compete in the Open Weights Divisions.

\*Only individuals who are citizens or legal permanent residents of a designated country within each region are eligible to race. This excludes temporary visa holders such as tourists, students, or other non-resident classifications (commonly referred to as legal aliens). Proof of eligibility must be provided through an original government-issued ID. Racers with dual or multiple citizenships are only eligible to qualify in one Regional Championship.

This means: All racers that enter an OPEN Regional Championship race compete in the OPEN weights division. The Regional Championships will still hold World Championship qualifier slots. These are the only races in which you can qualify in Single Men/Women or Doubles Men/Women divisions for the World Championships without competing with Pro weights!

Whether you’re a seasoned competitor or a newcomer to the sport, the HYROX Regional Championships are the perfect gateway to put your fitness to the test against others in your respective age group and push yourself to new heights.

- HYROX Open American Regional Championships 2026: Washington (DC), USA
- HYROX Open APAC Regional Championships 2026: Brisbane, Australia
- HYROX Open EMEA Regional Championships 2026: London Olympia, UK

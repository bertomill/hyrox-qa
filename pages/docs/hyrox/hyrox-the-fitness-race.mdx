# About the Race
## HYROX is fitness racing

## HYROX is fitness racing

HYROX combines both running & functional workout stations, where participants run 1km, followed by 1 functional workout station, repeated eight times.

Each race is hosted indoors in expansive exhibition halls, creating an immersive and electrifying race, where your spectators can support you from the very beginning to the very end.

This race format remains consistent across the globe, enabling global leaderboards & a cumulative World Championships at the end of each race season.

Accommodating both professional athletes, and everyday fitness enthusiasts looking to take their training to the next level, HYROX is the sport for everybody.

## Race Format

SkiErg

1000m SkiErg

The first HYROX workout station is 1000m on the Ski Erg. This erg predominantly targets the arm, shoulder & core muscles, however when done efficiently, it also involves muscles in the lower body – making the Ski Erg a full body workout.

Sled Push

50m Sled Push

The second workout station is 50m of Sled Push. This is one station you do not want to come unprepared for… so make sure you try it out at least once before your race and invest in some grippy shoes! This movement targets the lower body muscles, including the entire posterior chain, core & anterior thigh muscles in particular.

Sled Pull

50m Sled Pull

Get ready to use your glutes, back, biceps & the entire trunk during workout station three – 50m of Sled Pull.

Burpee Broad Jumps

80m Burpee Broad Jump

Born in 1939, the fourth workout station is a full body workout that is both loved and hated at the same time. Trying these for the first time may feel hard, but many of our regular athletes now consider this station to be one of their favourites!

Rowing

1000m Row

Station number five is the second ergometer in this fitness race. 1000m of rowing marks the beginning of the second half of your HYROX race.

Farmers Carry

200m Farmers Carry

For 200m of Farmers Carry, engagement of your upper back muscles, core & grip strength is required. This workout station is easy to practise on your weekly shop…

Sandbag Lunges

100m Sandbag Lunges

10, 20 or 30 kilograms on your back whilst lunging? Welcome to workout station number seven. Primarily targets the thigh and glute muscles, this one is a burner…

Wall Balls

100 Wall Balls

The final station… Wall Balls. With the finish line in sight, it’s time to finish your race in style & join the #HYROXFAMILY.

14 RULES OF
CONDUCT
By registering for a HYROX event, racers are agreeing
to compete in a fair and honorable manner and to
abide by the HYROX Code of Conduct, which upholds
the core values that ensure a respectful and inclusive
race environment for all.
Poor sportsmanship e.g., attempts at deception,
manipulation, excessive disputes as well as
disrupting and/or obstructing other participants can
lead to penalties, disqualification, a lifetime ban from
HYROX races and/or legal action.
Any participant who is disqualified from a HYROX race
or banned from future events will not receive a refund
for any fees or dues. This also applies to behavior that
could harm or disturb participants, volunteers, staff,
sponsors and spectators. Any of the aforementioned
actions may be taken against any participant at the
discretion of event organisers.

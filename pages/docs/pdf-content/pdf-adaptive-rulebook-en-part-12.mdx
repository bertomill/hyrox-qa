11. EVENT DAY SCHEDULE
On event day participants will encounter the following areas.
11.1 Registration, Timing Chip and Wristbands
Once participants arrive at the venue, they will need to attend the athlete
Check-in area where they  will receive their timing chip, start number and
wristband. Participants need to bring a government issued photo ID and
their registration confirmation.
Depending on the division, the wristband will be either white, grey or
black. It is used to identify the participant’s start wave and division during
the competition and must be worn visibly on the wrist.
Each participant also receives a timing chip for recording the participants
time(s) during the competition. This chip must be attached to an ankle.
Any other position may lead to an invalid or incomplete time record -
correctly wearing the timing chip on an ankle thoughout the race is the
competitors responsibility. Doubles and relays must carry one chip per
participant. Doubles = 2 Timing Chips; Relay = 4 Timing Chips.

Changing rooms and a secure bag drop will be available at the venue
although the organiser accepts no responsibility for any lost or stolen
bags or items.

# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 18 of 23

*Part 18 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

1 No warnings are given, it is either a rep or a no-
rep.
2 Each missing rep will incur a 15-second penalty.
3 If a racer uses powdered chalk at the wall ball
workout station, a 2 minute penalty will apply.
WALL BALL PENALTY PROTOCOL
1 Digital Wall Ball Target Protocol
When digital Wall Ball targets are in use, the system will
automatically register both valid reps and no-reps. These
will be displayed in real-time on the racer interface.
Judges are responsible for assessing the racer’s starting
position and squat depth. If a no-rep is identified by the
Judge, it will be recorded using their digital interface and
displayed on the racer’s screen.
Racers may only proceed to the Finisher Stage once they
confirm their digital interface shows that 100 valid Wall
Ball repetitions have been completed.
If the racer leaves their station before reaching 100
valid reps, they will not be called back to complete the
remainder. Instead, a 15-second time penalty will be
applied for each incomplete repetition.
A squat depth box may be used at the Judge’s discretion
to assist in assessing whether a racer’s squat meets
the required depth. They cannot be requested by a racer.
These boxes are not to be used for resting or sitting–
they serve solely as a depth indicator, not as a resting
opportunity during the workout.
Attention
2 Squat Depth Boxes

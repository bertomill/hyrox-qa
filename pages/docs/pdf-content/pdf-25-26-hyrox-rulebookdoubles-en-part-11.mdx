# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 11 of 23

*Part 11 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

3 After completing the required distance, the racer
must remain with both feet on the platform and
raise an arm to signal to a Judge that the required
distance has been completed.
4 The racer may only leave their SkiErg upon
receiving the Judge’s confirmation of completion.
5 The damper setting on the ergometer is preset
to resistance 6 for all divisions - this may be
adjusted as many times as desired by the working
DTM [only].
6 The resting DTM remains in the marked area. It is
not allowed to pass the SkiErg handles from one
DTM to the other.
1 If the racer’s feet move from the SkiErg base, this
will result in a formal warning.
2 A second infringement will result in a 15-second
penalty.
3 Each subsequent infringement will incur an
additional 15-second penalty–no further warnings
will be issued.
4 If the racer leaves before completing the 1,000
meters, they will receive a time penalty or be
disqualified, depending on the severity of the
violation.
SKIERG PENALTY PROTOCOL
1 Each pair of racers will be assigned a sled lane
by a member of the judging team. It is mandatory
that the racer uses the assigned sled lane.
2 Both sled and racers must be completely behind
the white line prior to starting.
3 The sled must always pass the 12.5m mark [end
of the lane] entirely before changing direction.
4 The resting DTM must walk immediately behind
the working DTM. If the walking DTM obstructs
other racers e.g. by walking in a neighbouring
lane, this will be treated as an infringement.
5 As soon as the racers completes 4 x 12.5m lanes
and the entire sled passes the line, the station is
complete.
6 If the racers completes less than four lanes, a
penalty of 3 minutes per missing lane will be
applied.
9.2 SLED PUSH

50 METERS

Flex-Add on Guidelines \| Flex Add-On vs. No Flex Add-On

For the 2025/26 HYROX season, we’ve introduced the Flex Add-On to give athletes more flexibility and peace of mind in case of unexpected changes. It allows you to request a refund or make certain changes to your ticket up to 1 day before the race.

If you’re confident you’ll attend and want a more cost-effective option, you can choose a ticket without the Flex Add-On.

Here’s what you need to know when purchasing with or without the Flex Add-On:

1. **Singles Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- **Full Refund\*:** Available up to 7 days before the event.
- **50% Refund\*:** Available up to 1 day before the event.
- **Name Changes:** Not available.

2. **Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- **Full Refund\*:** Available up to 7 days before the event.
- **50% Refund\*:** Available up to 1 day before the event.
- **One Name Change:** Allowed up to 1 day before the event via your HYROX Account.

3. **Singles/Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + No Flex**

- **No Flexibility:** This option does not allow any changes after purchase. This includes no ticket modifications, name changes, or refunds.

\*All refunds exclude the Flex Fee and must be requested via your HYROX Account.

**Important:** For the 2025/26 season, we will no longer offer transfers to other events or division changes. Please ensure you select your ticket carefully, as changes to ticket types cannot be made once your booking is confirmed. **Additionally, the Flex Add-On cannot be added after the initial purchase.**

**Point of Personalisation**

You will be required to personalise your ticket during the booking process. Before completing your purchase, please provide the following information for each Athlete Ticket:

**First & Last Name \| Email \| DOB \| Nationality**

Please ensure all athlete details are entered correctly during checkout. If incorrect information is entered, no changes can be made online or on-site unless the Flex Add-On was purchased. With the Flex Add-On, only one change is allowed.

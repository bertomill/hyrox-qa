Flex-Add on Guidelines \| Flex Add-On vs. No Flex Add-On

For the 2025/26 HYROX season, we’ve introduced the Flex Add-On to give athletes more flexibility and peace of mind in case of unexpected changes. It offers a simple way to request a refund or make changes to your ticket up to 1 day before the race.

Or, if you are absolutely certain you will make it and want a more cost-effective option, you can purchase a ticket without the Flex Add-On.

Here’s what you need to know when purchasing with or without the Flex Add-On:

1. **Singles Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- **Full Refund:** Up to 7 days before the event.
- **50% Refund:** Up to 1 day before the event.
- **Name Changes:** Not permitted.
- **Event Transfers:** Not permitted

2. **Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + Flex Add-On**

- **Full Refund:** Up to 7 days before the event.
- **50% Refund:** Up to 1 day before the event.
- **One Name Change:** Allowed up to 1 day before the event via your HYROX Account.
- **Event Transfers:** Not permitted

3. **Singles/Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + No Flex**

- **No Flexibility:** This option does not allow any changes after purchase. This includes no ticket modifications, name changes, or refunds.

\*All refunds exclude the Flex Fee and can be claimed via your HYROX Account.

**Important:** For the 2025/26 season, we will no longer offer transfers to other events or division changes. Please ensure you select your ticket carefully, as changes to ticket types cannot be made once your booking is confirmed. Additionally, the Flex Add-On cannot be added after the initial purchase.

We are very proud to have partnered up with Macmillan Cancer Support to help them be there for the 3.5 million people living with cancer across the UK. It’s never been more crucial for Macmillan to be there for people with cancer, providing a listening ear and information, advice and support, whenever and wherever they need them.

To race for a great cause, simply opt in for a ‘Charity Entry’ spot and pledge to fundraise either £400 for a solo entry or £800 with your partner for a double entry.

Your fundraising can help Macmillan fund many of the vital services they offer:

- £185 could provide emotional support to one person living with cancer for around eight weeks, through ongoing and regular support sessions with one of our Macmillan Buddies.
- £482 could support our Cancer Information and Support team to run our Macmillan Support Line phone service for 1 hour. In this time, they could deal with 24 calls and web enquiries from people who want questions answered, need practical or financial support.
- £720 could help run our Online Community forum for 1 day. In this time, 1,927 people affected by cancer in the UK can give emotional and practical support to each other on 27 Macmillan Internal anything to do with cancer – from treatments, to coping with everyday life, to the death of a loved one.

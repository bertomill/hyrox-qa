8\. Nov. 2025– 9\. Nov. 2025

Bigger, better, and breaking new ground — the second HYROX Korea race of 2025 is taking us to Seoul for the very first time!

We’re not just heading to a brand-new city, we’re making history with Korea’s first-ever 2-day HYROX event.

Are you ready to take on 8 x 1km of running plus 8 workout stations? No excuses, it’s time to step up and accept the challenge.

The choice is yours: compete solo in HYROX Open/Pro, share the load with a mate in HYROX Doubles/Doubles Pro, or grab 3 buddies and take on the HYROX relay.

Get ready, Seoul. This is going to be epic. Registration opens soon!

Flex Add-on guidelines \| Flex add-on vs no flex add-on

For the 2025/26 HYROX season, we’ve introduced the Flex Add-On to give athletes more flexibility and peace of mind in case of unexpected changes. It offers a simple way to request a refund or make changes to your ticket up to 1 day before the race.

Or, if you are absolutely certain you will make it and want a more cost-effective option, you can purchase a ticket without the Flex Add-On.

Here’s what you need to know when purchasing with or without the Flex Add-On:

Singles Division Ticket + Flex Add-On

Full Refund: Up to 7 days before the event.

50% Refund: Up to 1 day before the event.

Name Changes: Not permitted.

Event Transfers: Not permitted

Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + Flex Add-On

Full Refund: Up to 7 days before the event.

50% Refund: Up to 1 day before the event.

One Name Change: Allowed up to 1 day before the event via your HYROX Account.

Event Transfers: Not permitted

Note: Both options exclude Charity Tickets from their offerings.

Singles/Doubles/Relay Division Ticket + No Flex

No Flexibility: This option does not allow any changes after purchase. This includes no ticket modifications, name changes, or refunds.

\*All refunds exclude the Flex Fee and can be claimed via your HYROX Account.

Important: For the 2025/26 season, we will no longer offer transfers to other events or division changes. Please ensure you select your ticket carefully, as changes to ticket types cannot be made once your booking is confirmed. Additionally, the Flex Add-On cannot be added after the initial purchase.

Point of Personalisation

In addition, we will require you to personalise your ticket directly during the booking process. Before completing your ticket purchase, you will be asked to enter the following information for each Athlete Ticket:

First & Last Name \| Email \| Gender \| DOB \| Nationality

Please ensure all athlete details are entered correctly during the checkout process. If you enter incorrect information, you won’t be able to make any changes to your ticket online or on-site unless you selected the Flex add-on. Only with the Flex option 1 change is allowed.

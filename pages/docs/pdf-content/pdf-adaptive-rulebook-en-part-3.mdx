# ADAPTIVE RULEBOOK EN - Part 3 of 14

*Part 3 of 14 from ADAPTIVE_RULEBOOK_EN.pdf (24 pages total)*

Seated With Hip Function (SWHF) Division
This division includes seated athletes who retain full or partial hip function
but have impairments that prevent them from standing or walking. These
athletes may use a wheelchair but have the ability to engage their hips for
seated exercises and movements.
Seated Without Hip Function (SWOHF) Division
This division includes seated athletes who lack functional hip movement
due to impairments. These athletes use a wheelchair for mobility and
cannot engage the hips during physical activity, but may still retain core
and upper-body function.
Seated Without Core Function (SWOC) Division
Athletes in this division have impairments that prevent both hip and core
function. They rely on wheelchairs for mobility and cannot engage their
core muscles for stability or movement, but may retain upper-body
function.
If your impairment does not fall within the listed divisions, we encourage
you to contact us directly. As this system is an ongoing project, we are
committed to continuous improvement and highly value feedback to
ensure a more inclusive and accurate classification process.
Classification Notice
Athletes must be officially classified into one of the above divisions to
ensure eligibility. These divisions are reserved for individuals with
permanent impairments, and athletes with temporary injuries (e.g., due to
knee surgery) do not qualify for adaptive categories.

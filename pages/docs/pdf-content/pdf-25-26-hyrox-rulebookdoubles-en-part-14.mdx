# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 14 of 23

*Part 14 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

11 The workout station is completed once the
working DTM jumps over the finish line. If either
foot lands on the finish line, another burpee broad
jump must be completed.
12 The resting DTM must walk behind the working
DTM at all times and must not obstruct other
racers e.g. by walking alongside their working
DTM. Doing so will be treated as an infringement.
13 When transitioning between DTMs, the resting
DTM will begin by placing their hands where the
working DTM’s feet landed, toes and fingers in line.
Failure to do so will be treated as an infringement.
It is the racer’s responsibility to make it clear for
the Judges that they are meeting all movement
standards.
1 A racer’s first infringement will result in a formal
warning.
2 A second infringement will result in a 15-second
penalty.
3 Each subsequent infringement will incur an
additional 15-second penalty—no further
warnings will be issued.
BURPEE BROAD JUMP PENALTY PROTOCOL
1 Prior to starting, the monitor will be [re]set by the
Judging Team.
2 Racers’ feet must be on their rowers’ foot plates
and their backside on the seat before taking hold
of the rower handle. Their feet must remain on the
foot plates at all times.
3 After completing 1,000m, the racer must remain
seated and raise their arm to request a Judge
confirm that the required distance has been
completed.
4 The racer may only dismount their rower and leave
the workout station after receiving the Judge’s
confirmation of completion.

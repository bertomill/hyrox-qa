## One HYROX Community

## One HYROX Community

Our goal at HYROX is to create a global movement of like-minded people, who all share the same passion of community, fitness, competition & a healthy lifestyle.

Our community is one of a kind and has been at the very heart of the rapid growth of HYROX all around the world. The #HYROXFAMILY is what unites us all, whether you are an athlete, a supporter, a volunteer, a judge or a partner gym.

To get involved, head over to your local country website to sign up as a volunteer.

## Race for Impact: Turn Your HYROX Race into a Force for Good

HYROX is all about pushing limits—now, you can race for a cause that matters. In partnership with High Impact Athletes (HIA), we’re launching Race for Impact, a chance to fundraise for global charities while competing.

You’ll have the chance to Race for Impact by choosing the Charity Ticket option when you sign up for your next HYROX event. From there, you’ll create your fundraising platform via HIA and choose from one of four important cause areas to focus your efforts on:

- Global Health
- Climate Solutions
- Mental Health
- Women’s Empowerment

The minimum fundraising requirement is €300, and your mission is simple: rally support from your network to help meet that goal before race day.

The charity ticket is discounted to encourage as many people as possible to fundraise. To prevent misuse, anyone who doesn’t meet the minimum goal will be blacklisted and won’t be able to purchase charity tickets in the future. But don’t worry—High Impact Athletes will be with you every step of the way to help you archive the target! Any questions left? Feel free to reach out via [help@raceforimpact.com](mailto:help@raceforimpact.com)

**UK & Northern Ireland Charity Partner remains McMillan**

Participants in the UK and Northern Ireland can race for Macmillan Cancer Support, aiding their vital work in cancer care.

**Join the Impact Community**

By racing, you’ll be part of a community making a difference. Choose your cause, set your goal, and get started. Together, we can create lasting change.

Let’s Race for Impact and make a difference!

## Testimonials

HYROX has changed the way I train and go about my sport. It was the perfect combination of strength and endurance for me that I could not find in other sport competition and it is organized in a very professional manner.

My best friend convinced me to participate in a HYROX Doubles and we started going to the gym together. It took us 1h and 55 minutes and I loved every minute of the experience

HYROX has had such a positive impact on my gym. After COVID, it brought us all together, train harder and have fun at the same time. We traveled to HYROX Amsterdam with 47 members, the energy in the hall was amazing and I am so proud of all members who took on the challenge. More to come for sure

1 Complete all workout stations in the correct order.
2 Enter and Exit each workout station via the correct
routes.
3 Exiting a workout station via the workout station
‘IN’ arch will result in a 2 minute time penalty.
4 Complete the prescribed number of repetitions
and/or distances.
5 Perform each exercise according to the movement
standards.
6 Perform the exercises/movements using the
correct weight[s].
7 Only use a piece of equipment/lane/wall ball
station assigned by a member of the Race Crew.
Failure to do so will incur a 2-minute penalty per
infringement.
8 Only event-provided chalk may be used, and only
at the workout stations where it is provided. Chalk
is not to be taken to any other workout stations or
used at different workout stations. Doing so will
incur a 2-minute penalty per infringement.
9 To avoid creating slip hazards for other racers
and staff, the fluids provided at aid stations are
for drinking only. They are not to be used for
active cooling [e.g. pouring water over the head or
body]. Doing so will incur a 2-minute penalty per
infringement.
All HYROX courses comprise the same distances
and combine the Run Course, Roxzone and workout
station distances.
The running splits are always around 1,000 meters;
depending on the venue, this may be split between
1-5 running laps.
In some cases, the first/last running lap may be less
than 1,000 meters due to the location of the start
tunnel. In these cases, these missing meters will be
balanced out during the last lap.
On the run course, there is a line dividing the running
course into two zones: Fast Lane [smaller, on the
inside line] and Running Lane [larger, on the outside
line]. Racers running at a 4/km pace or faster are
required to use the Fast Lane, while other racers
should stay in the Running Lane. In the event that
HYROX crew are directing the Fast Lane, all racers
must comply with their instructions.

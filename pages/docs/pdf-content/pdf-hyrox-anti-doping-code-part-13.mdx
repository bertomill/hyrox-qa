5.2 Authority for the Organization and Performance of Testing
As a general rule, any Athlete may be required to provide a Sample at any time and at
any place. HYROX-World shall be responsible for the organization and performance
of Out-of-Competition and In-Competition Testing (thus testing at the venue) for all
Athletes subject to the scope of application of the HYROX-ADC and bound by the
rules and regulations of HYROX-World. HYROX-World will notify its Athletes about the
nature and extent of the testing without undue delay. Athletes who are subject to a
period of Ineligibility may be subjected to Testing during their period of Ineligibility.
5.3 to 5.4 [Left blank]
5.5 Performance of Testing
The performance of Testing shall be according to the International Standard for
Testing and Investigations. HYROX-World shall be entitled, but not obliged, to
coordinate its Testing via an automated data processing system.
5.6 Selection of Athletes for Testing
HYROX-World shall select the Athletes who will be subject to Testing according to its
own discretion. HYROX-World shall not owe any statement of reasons for the
selection made. The selection procedure shall be in accordance with the
specifications of this Code and the relevant provisions of the International Standard
for Testing and Investigations. HYROX-World is authorized to transfer the selection
decision to a third party and to grant the third party a free discretion with regard to
the selection. The Athletes subject to Provisional Suspension or Ineligibility may be
subjected to Testing Out-of-Competition during the Provisional Suspension or
Ineligibility.
5.7 Retirement of Athletes
If an Athlete retires from sport while subject to a period of Ineligibility, the Athlete
must notify HYROX-World in text form (§ 126b German Civil Code – Bürgerliches
Gesetzbuch – BGB) of such retirement. If the Athlete then wishes to return to active
competition, the Athlete shall not compete in HYROX events until the Athlete has
made himself or herself available for Testing by giving six months prior notice (or
notice equivalent to the period of Ineligibility remaining as of the date the Athlete
retired, if that period was longer than six months) to HYROX-World.
5.8 Investigations and Intelligence Gathering
HYROX-World shall conduct investigations based on the International Standard for
Testing and Investigations according to its own discretion. It shall not owe any
reasons for the type and scope of the investigation measures.

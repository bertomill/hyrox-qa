*Part 28 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

HYROX-ADC, page 16 of 27
The extent to which the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility may be suspended
shall be based on the seriousness of the anti-doping rule violation committed by the
Athlete or other Person and the significance of the Substantial Assistance provided
by the Athlete or other Person to the effort to eliminate doping in sport, non-
compliance with the HYROX-ADC/WADC/NADC and/or sport integrity violations. No
more than three-quarters of the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility may be
suspended. If the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility is a lifetime, the non-
suspended period under this Article must be no less than five years. For purposes of
this paragraph, the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility shall not include any
period of Ineligibility that could be added under Article 10.9.3.2.
If so, requested by an Athlete or other Person who seeks to provide Substantial
Assistance, HYROX-World shall allow the Athlete or other Person to provide the
information to it subject to a Without Prejudice Agreement. If the Athlete or other
Person fails to continue to cooperate and to provide the complete and credible
Substantial Assistance upon which a suspension of Consequences was based,
HYROX-World shall reinstate the original Consequences. If HYROX-World decides to
reinstate suspended Consequences or decides not to reinstate suspended
Consequences, that decision may be appealed by any Person entitled to appeal under
Article 13.
10.7.1.2 to 10.7.1.3 [Left blank]
10.7.2 Admission of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation in the Absence of Other Evidence
Where an Athlete or other Person voluntarily admits the commission of an anti-
doping rule violation before having received notice of a Sample collection which could
establish an anti-doping rule violation (or, in the case of an anti-doping rule violation
other than Article 2.1, before receiving first notice of the admitted violation pursuant
to Article 7) and that admission is the only reliable evidence of the violation at the
time of admission, then the period of Ineligibility may be reduced, but not below one-
third of the period of Ineligibility otherwise applicable.
10.7.3 Application of Multiple Grounds for Reduction of a Sanction
Where an Athlete or other Person establishes entitlement to reduction in sanction
under more than one provision of Article 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7, before applying any
reduction or suspension under Article 10.7, the otherwise applicable period of
Ineligibility shall be determined in accordance with Articles 10.2, 10.3, 10.5, and 10.6. If
the Athlete or other Person establishes entitlement to a reduction or suspension of
the period of Ineligibility under Article 10.7, then the period of Ineligibility may be
reduced or suspended, but not below one-fourth of the otherwise applicable period of
Ineligibility.
10.8 Results Management Agreements
10.8.1 Reduction for Certain Anti-Doping Rule Violations Based on Early Admission and
Acceptance of Sanction
Where an Athlete or other Person, after being notified by HYROX-World of a potential
anti-doping rule violation that carries an asserted period of Ineligibility of two or more
years (including any period of Ineligibility asserted under Article 10.4), admits the
violation and accepts the asserted period of Ineligibility no later than 20 days after
receiving notice of an anti-doping rule violation charge, the period may be reduced by
a maximum of one-half of the period of Ineligibility of the Athlete or other Person
asserted by HYROX-World. Where the Athlete or other Person receives the reduction

HYROX-ADC, page 15 of 27
10.6.1.2 Contaminated Products
In cases where the Athlete or other Person can establish both No Significant Fault or
Negligence and that the detected Prohibited Substance (other than a Substance of
Abuse) came from a Contaminated Product, then the period of Ineligibility shall be, at
a minimum, a reprimand and no period of Ineligibility, and at a maximum, two years
Ineligibility, depending on the Athlete or other Person’s degree of Fault.
10.6.1.3 Protected Persons or Recreational Athletes
Where the anti-doping rule violation not involving a Substance of Abuse is committed
by a Protected Person or Recreational Athlete, and the Protected Person or
Recreational Athlete can establish No Significant Fault or Negligence, then the period
of Ineligibility shall be, at a minimum, a reprimand and no period of Ineligibility, and at
a maximum, two years Ineligibility, depending on the Protected Person or
Recreational Athlete’s degree of Fault.
10.6.2 Application of No Significant Fault or Negligence beyond the Application of Article
10.6.1
If an Athlete or other Person establishes in an individual case where Article 10.6.1 is
not applicable, that he or she bears No Significant Fault or Negligence, then, subject
to further reduction or elimination as provided in Article 10.7, the otherwise applicable
period of Ineligibility may be reduced based on the Athlete or other Person’s degree
of Fault, but the reduced period of Ineligibility shall not be less than one-half of the
period of Ineligibility and may not be less than one-third of the period of Ineligibility
otherwise applicable. If the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility is a lifetime, the
reduced period under this Article may be no less than eight years.
[Comment by HYROX-World: The reduction of a sanction by more than one-half of the
period shall apply to exceptional cases only and requires a separate justification.]
10.7 Elimination, Reduction, or Suspension of Period of Ineligibility or other Consequences
for Reasons other than Fault
10.7.1 Substantial Assistance in Discovering or Establishing HYROX ADC/WADC/NADC
Violations
10.7.1.1 HYROX-World may, prior to an appellate decision under Article 13 or the expiration of
the time to appeal, suspend a part of the Consequences (other than Disqualification
and mandatory Public Disclosure) imposed in an individual case where the Athlete or
other Person has provided Substantial Assistance to HYROX-World and/or an Anti-
Doping Organization, a criminal authority or professional disciplinary body which
results in: (a) HYROX-World and/or the Anti-Doping Organization discovering or
bringing forward an anti-doping rule violation by another Person; or (b) which results
in a criminal or disciplinary body discovering or bringing forward a criminal offense or
the breach of professional rules committed by another Person and the information
provided by the Person providing Substantial Assistance is made available to
HYROX-World; or (c) which results in WADA initiating a proceeding against a
Signatory, WADA-accredited laboratory or Athlete passport management unit (APMU;
as defined in the International Standard for Laboratories) for non-compliance with
the WADC, International Standard or Technical Document; or (d) with the approval by
WADA, which results in a criminal or disciplinary body bringing forward a criminal
offense or the breach of professional or sport rules arising out of a sport integrity
violation other than doping.

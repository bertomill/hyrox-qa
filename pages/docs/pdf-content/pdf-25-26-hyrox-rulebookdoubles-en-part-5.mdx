# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 5 of 23

*Part 5 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

All racers who have qualified in the age groups AG
U24-59 as an individual/single [HYROX MEN /
HYROX WOMEN / HYROX MEN PRO / HYROX WOMEN
PRO] have to complete the distances, reps and
weights of the PRO division at the championships.
For all other single racers who qualified in the AG 60+,
the weights, reps and distances remain unchanged.
The distances, reps and weights for this division
remain the same at the championships.
If a DOUBLES Team Member drops out, he/she can
be replaced. The only requirement is that the new
DOUBLES team member has to be the same gender
and age as the previous member. This way the age
group and the division will remain the same.

MEN/WOMEN PRO
5.3.2 DOUBLES MIXED
5.3 QUALIFICATION AS A
DOUBLES TEAM
Racers who have qualified for multiple divisions at
the WORLDS are permitted to compete in multiple
divisions as long as their allocated start times do not
conflict. Requests to change start times will not be
considered. Registering for multiple divisions is at a
racer’s own risk and refunds are not available in the
event that conflicting start times prevent a racer from
participating in multiple divisions.
All racers will start within their division and AG to
determine the AG Winner–AG WORLD CHAMPION. The
AG is set by the racer’s age at the qualifying event. AG
Winners do not qualify or prize money or the overall
winners title–World Champion of Fitness Racing.

The Elite 15 is a separate start wave that consists of
the fastest 15 racers of the Pro division [WOMEN PRO
and MEN PRO] of the current season leading up to the
WORLDS.
To learn more, you can read the ELITE 15 Qualification
System below.
Only racers within the Elite 15 Wave have the
opportunity to become the overall world champion
–World Champion of Fitness Racing–and win prize
money. The prize money available at each World
Championship will be announced in the respective
Elite 15 Guide.
Elite 15 racers are excluded from the individual AG
rankings at the WORLDS and are therefore not eligible
to become AG Winner in any of the Individual divisions.
HYROX reserves the right to hand out Wildcards and
invite other racers to the WORLDS at its discretion. In
addition, HYROX reserves the right to make changes
to the design of the race course and Roxzone e.g. to
improve spectator viewing or broadcast opportunities.

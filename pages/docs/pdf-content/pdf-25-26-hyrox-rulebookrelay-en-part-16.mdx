*Part 16 of 18 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookRelay_EN.pdf (35 pages total)*

9 EVENT DAY
SCHEDULE
On event day, racers will encounter the following
areas.
Once racers arrive at the venue, they will need to
attend the racer Check-in area where they will receive
their timing chip/ankle strap, racer number and wrist
lanyard.
Racers need to bring a government issued photo ID
and their registration confirmation.
Depending on the division, the wristband will be
either white, grey or black and/or green. This is used
to identify the participant’s start wave and division
during the race and must be worn visibly on the wrist.
Each racer also receives a timing chip for recording
the racer’s time[s] during the race. This chip must be
attached to an ankle.
Any other position may lead to an invalid or incomplete
time record–it is the racer’s responsibility to wear
the timing chip correctly on an ankle throughout
the race. Doubles and relays must carry one chip
per participant. Doubles = 2 Timing Chips; Relay = 4
Timing Chips.
9.1 REGISTRATION, TIMING
CHIP AND WRISTBANDS
Changing rooms and a secure bag drop will be
available at the venue. However, the organiser accepts
no responsibility for any lost or stolen bags or items.

If a racer does not run the correct number of laps, a
time penalty of 3-7 minutes per lap will be applied
and added to their final result time.

could be 5 minutes. The racer’s final result time is
1:24 but if they missed 2 run laps throughout the
race their final result time will be 1:34 [2 x 5 minute
penalties].
If a racer does not complete the station in the correct
sequence [1-8], they are permitted to
complete missing stations prior to entering station 8
[Wall Balls].
Completing the s in the incorrect order will result in
a 3-minute penalty. If more than one is completed
out of order, the participant will automatically be
disqualified.

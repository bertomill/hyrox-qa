By registering for a HYROX event participants are agreeing to compete in
a fair and honorable manner.  Poor sportsmanship e.g., attempts at
deception, manipulation, excessive disputes as well as disrupting and/or
obstructing other participants can lead to penalties, disqualification, a
lifetime ban from HYROX competitions and/or legal action. Any
participant who is disqualified from a HYROX competition or banned for
future events will not receive a refund for any fees or dues. This also
applies to other behavior that could harm or disturb participants,
volunteers, staff, sponsors, and spectators. At event organizers discretion
any of the aforementioned actions may be taken against any participant.
13.1 Poor sportsmanship
Any form of poor sportsmanship, threatening and/or abusive behaviour
towards event staff, volunteers, spectators or fellow competitors can lead
to penalties and/or disqualification. These can also be applied
retrospectively following a race.
13.2 General Conduct
Any littering, spitting, nostril clearing or water abuse is not allowed and
can lead to penalties and/or disqualification.

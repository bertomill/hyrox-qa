presumed to be scientifically valid. An Athlete or other Person who wishes to
challenge whether the conditions for such presumption are met or who wishes to
rebut such presumption of scientific validity may, within 10 days, appeal to the appeal
body within the meaning of §§ 1025 et seq. of the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung – ZPO) as specified in Article 13. The appeal body shall appoint
an appropriate scientific expert to assist the panel in its evaluation of the challenge.
3.2.2 WADA-accredited laboratories, and other laboratories approved by WADA, are
presumed to have conducted Sample analysis and custodial procedures in
accordance with the International Standard for Laboratories. The Athlete or other
Person may rebut this presumption by establishing that a departure from the
International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could in the hearing body’s
view (see 3.2.1) reasonably have caused the Adverse Analytical Finding. If the Athlete
or other Person rebuts the preceding presumption by showing that a departure from
the International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have
caused the Adverse Analytical Finding, then HYROX-World shall have the burden to
establish that such departure did not cause the Adverse Analytical Finding.
3.2.3 Departures from any other International Standard or other anti-doping rule or policy
set forth in this Code or the WADC shall not invalidate analytical results or other
evidence of an anti-doping rule violation, and shall not constitute a defense to an
anti-doping rule violation; provided, however, if the Athlete or other Person
establishes that a departure from one of the specific International Standard
provisions listed below could reasonably have caused an anti-doping rule violation
based on an Adverse Analytical Finding or whereabouts failure, then HYROX-World
shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the Adverse
Analytical Finding:
(a) a departure from the International Standard for Testing and Investigations
related to Sample collection or Sample handling which could reasonably have
caused an anti-doping rule violation based on an Adverse Analytical Finding, in
which case HYROX-World shall have the burden to establish that such departure
did not cause the Adverse Analytical Finding;
(b) a departure from the International Standard for Results Management or
International Standard for Testing and Investigations related to Adverse
Passport Finding which could reasonably have caused an anti-doping rule
violation, in which case HYROX-World shall have the burden to establish that
such departure did not cause the anti-doping rule violation;
(c) a departure from the International Standard for Results Management related to
the requirement to provide notice to the Athlete of the B Sample opening which
could reasonably have caused an anti-doping rule violation based on an Adverse
Analytical Finding, in which case HYROX-World shall have the burden to
establish that such departure did not cause the Adverse Analytical Finding.
3.2.4 The facts established by a decision of a state court or professional disciplinary
tribunal of competent jurisdiction (e.g. in Germany: disciplinary bodies of the
Bundeswehr or the Medical Association) which is not the subject of a pending appeal
shall be irrebuttable evidence against the Athlete or other Person to whom the
decision pertained of those facts unless the Athlete or other Person establishes that
the decision violated principles of natural justice.
3.2.5 The hearing panel within the meaning of §§ 1025 et sec. ZPO in a hearing on an anti-
doping rule violation may draw an inference adverse to the Athlete or other Person

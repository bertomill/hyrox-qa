may be established by any reliable means. This would include, for example, reliable
laboratory or other forensic testing conducted outside of a WADA-accredited or
approved laboratories.
6.2 Purpose of Analysis of Samples and data
Samples and related analytical data or Doping Control information shall be analyzed
to detect Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods identified on the Prohibited
List (see wada-ama.org/prohibited-list) and other substances as directed by WADA
pursuant to Article 4.5, or to assist HYROX-World in profiling relevant parameters in
the urine, blood or any other matrix of an Athlete for Anti-Doping purpose. This
includes DNA or genome profiling as well as any other legitimate anti-doping purpose.
6.3 Use of Samples and data for research purposes
Samples, related analytical data and Doping Control information may be used for anti-
doping research purposes, although no Sample may be used for research purposes
without the written consent of the Athlete. Samples, related analytical data or Doping
Control information used for research purposes shall first be processed in such a
manner as to prevent Samples and related analytical data or Doping Control
information being traced back to a particular Athlete. Any research involving Samples
and related analytical data, or Doping Control information shall be conducted in
accordance with the principles set out in Article 19 WADC.
6.4 Performance of the Analysis and Reporting
The laboratories shall analyze Samples and report their results in conformity with the
International Standard for Laboratories (see wada-ama.org/international-
standards/international-standard-laboratories). Laboratories may perform at their
own initiative and cost analysis of Samples for Prohibited Substances or Prohibited
Methods not included in the standard analysis scope specified by WADA or not
specified or requested by HYROX-World. The results of such analyses shall be
reported to HYROX-World and shall have the same Consequences as any other
analysis results.
6.5 Further Analysis of a Sample prior to or during Pre-adjudication/Adjudication
There shall be no limitation on the authority of a laboratory to conduct repeat or
additional analysis on a Sample prior to the time HYROX-World notifies an Athlete
that the Sample is the basis for an Article 2.1 anti-doping rule violation charge. If after
such notification HYROX-World wishes to conduct additional analysis on that Sample,
it may do so with the consent of the Athlete or approval from a hearing body within
the meaning of §§ 1025 et sec. ZPO.
6.6 Further Analysis of a Sample after it has been Reported as Negative or has Otherwise
not Resulted in an Anti-Doping Rule Violation Charge
After a laboratory has reported a Sample as negative, or the Sample has not
otherwise resulted in an anti-doping rule violation charge, it may be stored and
subjected to further analyses for the purpose of Article 6.2 at any time exclusively at
the direction of HYROX-World.
6.7 Split of A or B Sample
Where HYROX-World or the laboratory (with HYROX-World ́s approval) wishes to split
an A or B Sample for the purpose of using the first part of the split Sample for an A
Sample analysis and the second part of the split Sample for confirmation, then the
procedures set forth in the International Standard for Laboratories shall be followed.

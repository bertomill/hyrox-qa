# 25 26 HYROX RulebookSingles EN - Part 16 of 22

*Part 16 of 22 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookSingles_EN.pdf (44 pages total)*

1 It is the racer’s responsibility to ensure they have
selected the correct weight of wall ball relevant to
their division [see below].
2 The racer must start by standing tall [hips and
knees extended], holding the wall ball with both
hands [see Fig 010] i.e. it is not permitted for
racers to pick the wall ball up from the ground and
immediately throw it at the target.
3 The racer then squats below parallel and throws
the ball [with both hands] as they stand up,
striking the correct target on the wallball rig–this
is counted as one repetition.
4 Each wall ball throw must strike the designated
target i.e. female racers must hit their target in
the strike zone, male racers must hit their target
in the strike zone.
5 After the ball touches the target, the racer either
catches the ball and initiates the movement again
or alternately, the racer allows the wall ball to hit
the ground before starting the movement again
i.e. standing tall, hips and knees extended before
commencing the squat. Racers are not permitted
to catch the ball after it bounces and continue
with the next repetition.
6 At the bottom position of the squat, the racer’s
hips must descend lower than their knees [also
known as; below parallel or below 90°] [see Fig
011].
7 Where no digital targets are in use, racers may only
proceed to the Finisher Stage once their Judge
confirms that 100 valid Wall Ball repetitions have
been completed.
8 Racers are permitted to remove their shoes
once they arrive at their designated target.
The racer must place the shoes under the rig.
After completing 100 valid wall balls the racer
is required to take their shoes with them to the
Finisher Stage–racers are not permitted to return
to the wall ball area after completing their race.
9 Racers must NOT run underneath the wall ball
rig when making their way to the Finisher Stage–
they must go via the outside of the wall ball rig.

# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 22 of 23

*Part 22 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

Time penalties can be issued on the run and at Stations
1-8. Time penalties depend on the infringement and
Station.
Many penalties are automatically detected by the
timing system using chip reads—for example,
incorrect use of the IN/OUT arches or missing sled
laps.
Infractions related to movement standards or rep
counts—such as using the wrong weights, failing to
return kettlebells correctly, or a no-rep on wall ball
squats—can be penalised in real time by Judges or
Head Judges.
Only Race Directors have the authority to disqualify
[DQ] a racer, based on input from Head Judges,
Judges, or their own direct observations.
For Stations 1–7, racers will receive one warning
per station for not meeting movement standards.
On the second infringement–regardless of type–the
repetition is deemed invalid and the racer will receive
the associated time or distance penalty. Any further
violations within the same station will incur additional
penalties.
13.2 TIME PENALTIES
Each time the system detects that partners are not
together, a 1-minute time penalty will be applied–
per run segment and/or workout station where the
infringement occurs. A maximum of three penalties
is allowed per team.
If a fourth infringement is recorded, the team will be
classified as Out of Competition and will not appear in
the official rankings.
“Remain together” is defined as being no more than
five seconds apart at any time. Best practice is to stay
within arm’s reach of each other throughout the race
to avoid triggering a penalty and to maintain smooth
transitions between segments.
Note: Certain violations may result in immediate penalties
without warning, depending on their severity.

If a participant has been disqualified by a Race Director
during a race, they will not receive any results data
from that race and will be excluded from all rankings
and awards related to it.
Once disqualified, the participant may not continue
competing in that specific race.
If a participant does not finish a station they will not
receive any results data and will be excluded from all
rankings and awards. However, they may continue
with the race [without a final time].
Any execution of a movement that either deviates
from the movement standards, and/or is unusual or
uncommon and/or results in a time advantage will not
be recognised and will result in an invalid repetition
[no rep] or a time penalty.

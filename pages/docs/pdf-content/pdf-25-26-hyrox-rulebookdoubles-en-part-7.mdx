HYROX EN DOUBLES RULEBOOK_25/26

Each DOUBLES Elite 15 race at a Major will include
the fastest 15 female and 15 male qualified racers.
Qualification to the Major events occurs via time
based qualification in Pro races over the past 356
days.
The time qualification is calculated as the average of
the two fastest verified individual Pro Division race
times achieved by any athlete within the past 365
days.
This 365-day window is a rolling period, meaning it
updates daily. At midnight [GMT] on each new day, the
earliest day in the previous 365-day period ‘expires’
and any new results from that day become eligible for
consideration.
This is a dynamic ranking that will be updated with
each race to always reflect the past 365 days from
that particular date. Times achieved in Major races
and WORLDS will be included in this ranking.
The winning Doubles Team of each Major earns an
auto qualification slot for the remaining Majors of
the current as well as the upcoming season–no roll
downs.
Podium place 1, 2 and 3 of each Major event directly
qualify the racers for the Doubles Elite 15 race at
WORLDS - if these racers have already qualified, the
slot will roll down to the next 3 pairs of racers in line,
so that at every Major, 3 female pairs and 3 male pairs
of racers will qualify for the DOUBLES ELITE 15 race
at WORLDS. If a pair of racers finishes in the Top 3 but
was already automatically qualified, the slot will roll
down to the next pair of racers of that respective
major.

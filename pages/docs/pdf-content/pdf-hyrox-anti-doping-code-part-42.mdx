HYROX-ADC, page 26 of 27
doping free level playing field. Education shall raise awareness, provide accurate information
(e.g. regarding the principle of Strict Liability, Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods
in accordance with the Prohibited List, the risks of supplement use or the use of medications
and Therapeutic Use Exemptions) and develop decision-making capability to prevent
intentional and unintentional anti-doping rule violations and other breaches of the HYROX-
ADC.
WADA (see wada-ama.org/education-and-training and adel.wada-ama.org/learn) as well as
the national anti-doping agencies (e.g. NADA, see nada.de/education) are generally
responsible for setting up education programs. Hyrox-World will, however, make reasonable
efforts to support the implementation of an education program for HYROX events based on
or referring to the programs already set up by WADA and/or national anti-doping agencies.
Hyrox-World will appoint an anti-doping officer serving as contact for Athletes. The Anti-
Doping Officer will regularly inform the Athletes about the current possibilities of education
(e.g. dates for information events or information materials).

ARTICLE 19 [Left blank]

ARTICLE 20 INTERPRETATION OF THE HYROX-ADC BASED ON THE WADC/NADC
20.1 The official text of the WADC shall be maintained by WADA and shall be published in
English and French. In the event of any conflict between the English and French
versions, the English version shall prevail. In the event of any conflict between WADC
and NADC, the WADC shall prevail. And, finally, in the event of any conflict between
the HYROX ADC and the WADC/NADC, the HYROX-ADC shall prevail.
20.2 The comments annotating various provisions of the WADC/NADC shall be used to
interpret the WADC/NADC. In the event of any conflict between the comments in the
WADC and the comments in the NADC, the comments in the WADC shall prevail. The
comments annotating certain provisions of the HYROX ADC which are indicated by
“Comment by Hyrox-World” shall be used to specifically interpret the HYROX-ADC.
20.3 WADC/NADC and HYROX-ADC shall be interpreted as independent and autonomous
texts and not by reference to the existing law or other provisions and policies
provided to Athletes by Hyrox-World. All headings are for convenience only and shall
not be deemed part of the substance of WADC/NADC and HYROX-ADC or to affect in
any way the language of the provisions to which they refer. Where the term “days” is
used, it shall mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.
20.4 to 20.6 [Left blank]
20.7 The Purpose, Scope and Organization of the World Anti-Doping Program and the
WADC/NADC and the Definitions in Appendix 1 of the WADC shall be considered
integral parts of the WADC/NADC as well as this HYROX-ADC.

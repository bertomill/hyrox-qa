26\. Sep. 2025– 28\. Sep. 2025

HYROX finally arrives in Rome for the first time!

Certainly the most anticipated and rumored location in the last season.

The Fiera di Roma will be the venue for the competition.

Rome, increasingly at the center of international sport, strengthens its status as a city that knows how to combine sport, tourism and culture by adding HYROX to its rich calendar of sports events: many athletes are expected to travel to compete, both from Italy and abroad, and to live a unique and unforgettable experience.

and/or abusive behaviour towards event staff, judges,
volunteers, spectators or fellow racers can lead to
penalties and/or disqualification. These penalties
can also be applied retrospectively following a race.
Poor sportsmanship is defined as attempts at
deception, manipulation or excessive disputes as well
as disrupting and/or obstructing other participants
can lead to penalties, disqualification, a lifetime ban
from HYROX races and/or legal action.
The following items are strictly forbidden at all times:
Littering is prohibited. For example, all paper cups
and used gel packaging must be discarded in the bins
provided, not on the Roxzone floor or run course. Each

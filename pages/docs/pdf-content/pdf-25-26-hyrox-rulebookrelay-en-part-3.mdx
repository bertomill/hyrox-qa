4.2 RELAY AGE GROUPS
Age groups are determined by the participant’s age
at the date of the event. In addition, the age groups
are classified based on the average age of the four
RELAY participants at the time of the event. e.g. RM1
is 24 years old, RM2 is 38, RM3 is 48 and RM4 is
40, the average age is 37.5, the RELAY Team will be
classified into age group UNDER 40.
The ranking system and the resulting overall ranking
is based on the fastest time in the respective division
of each event. Results are sorted from the fastest
to the slowest times. In addition, there is a ranking
within the age groups, also sorted from the fastest to
the slowest times.
If a racer competes twice within the same division,
only their fastest time will be considered for ranking
purposes, and they are not eligible to podium more
than once in that division for the same race.
The results will be published immediately after each
event ends, and will be available at results.hyrox.com.
Any incomplete running laps or deviation from
the prescribed repetition range or movement
standards will result in a penalty [see Penalties]
and/or disqualification. Penalties may be added or
amendments made for up to 48 hours after each
event ends.

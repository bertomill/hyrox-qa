# 25 26 HYROX RulebookRelay EN - Part 4 of 18

*Part 4 of 18 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookRelay_EN.pdf (35 pages total)*

5 THE RACE
HYROX TEAM RELAY is a 4-person-team race.
The RELAY Team can consist of either:
4 Female racers
4 Male racers
2 Female and 2 Male racers
A HYROX race consists of a 1km run followed by one,
repeated 8 times.
In order to complete the entire HYROX race and
receive a valid finishing time, the racers must start
at the designated start time, complete the runs and
workouts in the designated order [Run 1, workout
station 1, Run 2, workout station 2, etc.] until they
have completed a total of 8 km running and 8 workout
stations whilst wearing their issued timing chip on an
ankle at all times.
Each RM has to run 2 x 1 k and perform 2 workout
stations. Which run/workstations each RM completes
is entirely up to the team.
This means one RM can either perform 2 x 1 km runs
and 2 workout stations consecutively [back to back]
or can complete one and return to the Transition
Zone [TZ] whilst another RM completes the next run/
workout station.
A HYROX race operate using wave starts at regular
scheduled intervals [e.g. every 5 or 10 minutes,
depending on the division]. Each racer is assigned
an official start time, which is communicated prior to
race day and confirmed again at check-in.
Racers must have their official start time clearly
visible on their arm.
5.1 HYROX RELAY RACE

HYROX EN RELAY RULEBOOK_25/26

1 Any racer who starts in an earlier or later wave than their
official assigned start time without prior approval from
the Race Organisers will be Disqualified [DQ].
2 It is the racer’s responsibility to wear their timing chip
on an ankle at all times while racing. Failure to do so will
result in a ‘Did Not Start’ [DNS] leaderboard result.
3 Racers must avoid entering the Roxzone or run course
before their official start time, as doing so may trigger
their timing chip and result in an incorrect race time.

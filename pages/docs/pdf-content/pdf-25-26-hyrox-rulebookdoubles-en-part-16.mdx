# 25 26 HYROX RulebookDoubles EN - Part 16 of 23

*Part 16 of 23 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookDoubles_EN.pdf (47 pages total)*

9 It is required that the racer’s front foot must
completely cross the white line at the end of each
lane, and the finish line.
10 The racer does not need to lunge around the
turning points at the end of each lane. However,
they are required to restart each working section
with two feet behind the white line and by lunging
across it [see Fig 009].
11 During each sandbag transition between the
DTM’s, the sandbag must not be passed forward.
Sideways or backwards is permitted, never
forwards.
12 The resting DTM must walk behind the working
DTM at all times. It is not permitted to obstruct
other racers e.g. walking alongside the working
DTM. Doing so will be treated as an infringement.
13 The station is complete once the racer’s leading
foot completely crosses the finish line. They must
then return the sandbag to the correct marked
area.
1 If the racer fails to return their sandbag to the
correct area, a 30-second penalty shall apply.
If a racer returns to correct their infringement
before exiting the Roxzone, this penalty will not
be applied.
2 If a racer completes all/part of the Sandbag Lunge
using the incorrect weight, they are required
to repeat the entire workout station using the
correct weight. Failure to do so will result in
Disqualification [DQ].
3 The sandbag must remain on both shoulders at
all times and the racer is not permitted to put the
sandbag down at any time during the workout
station, including the turn zones.
4 Removing the sandbag from the shoulders will
result in a 15-second penalty i.e. no warning.
5 A second infringement will result in disqualification.

# Prepare for Hyrox
## Race Day

## Race Day

Hyrox has been created as the Fitness Race for Every Body, but let’s not forget, it is still a fitness race which requires training and preparation in strength as well as endurance.  8 x 1km of running and 8 functional workouts! The ultimate challenge of your body with natural skills movements tested to the maximum.  Together with Mintra Tilly, who designed the Race, we provide you ticks & tricks to help you prepare.

## 50% is Running

Some love it, others rather not think about it! A Hyrox race consists of 8 kilometers of running, split into 8 times 1 kilometer. So get that running into your training and build up your cardio, as you will be out for an average of 90 minutes.  It is also important to experience running after working the legs and arms, so simulate that Race Experience at home or in the gym.  Ever wondered how you run after pushing a 125kg sled for 50 meters? Or after your heartrate spikes during 80m of Burpee Broad Jumps. So mix up your training and you will start to enjoy your running more and more.

## Learn the Movement Standards

It is important to familiarize yourself with the Hyrox movement standards so that you train the exercises in the right manner and avoid bad movements and potential injuries. Experiment in the gym with your Certified Hyrox Coach with various techniques that can be applied and find the one that works best for you.

## Don't Start too Fast

We see it over and over again! People running their Personal Best during the first kilometer and pushing hard through the SkiErg. Who wouldn’t? The energy, the excitement in the venue, the music, friends and family cheering you on.  However, it is an endurance event, and can be compared to a half Marathon or an Olympic Distance Triathlon. So pace yourself, find your rhythm, control your heart rate, and you will perform at your best.

## Rest, Eat and Hydrate

During your training periods, in build up to the event, and on event day, don’t forget to rest, eat and stay hydrated. Specifically on the event day, you might be arriving a few hours before your start time to cheer on your friends, you get soaked up in the event excitement and before you know it, it is time to warm up and go to the Start Zone.  So make sure you drink plenty of water, you don’t use up too much energy so that you arrive at the Start Zone fresh and ready to go.

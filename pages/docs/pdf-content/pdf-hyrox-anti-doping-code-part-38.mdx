*Part 38 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

13.1 Decisions Subject to Appeal
Decisions made under the HYROX-ADC may be appealed as set forth below in Articles
13.2 through 13.4 or as otherwise provided in this Code. Such decisions shall remain
in effect while under appeal unless the appellate body orders otherwise.
13.1.1 Scope of Review Not Limited
The scope of review on appeal includes all issues relevant to the matter and is
expressly not limited to the issues or scope of review applied by HYROX-World in first
instance. Any party to the appeal may submit evidence, legal arguments and claims
that were not raised in the first instance hearing so long as they arise from the same
cause of action or same general facts or circumstances raised or addressed in the
first instance hearing.
13.1.2 Arbitral Tribunal shall Not Defer to the Findings Being Appealed
In making its decision, the arbitral tribunal within the meaning of §§ 1025 et seq. of
the German Code of Civil Procedure (“Zivilprozessordnung” – ZPO) agreed as
competent appeal body in case of 13.2.2 shall not give deference to the discretion
exercised by the Competition Committee whose decision is being appealed.
[Comment by Hyrox-World: All arbitral proceedings within the meaning of this
HYROX-ADC are de novo. Prior proceedings do not limit the evidence or carry weight
in the hearing before the arbitral tribunal.]
13.1.3 [Left blank]
13.2 Appeals from Decisions Regarding Anti-Doping Rule Violations, Consequences,
Provisional Suspensions, Implementation of Decisions and Authority
The following decisions may only be appealed exclusively as provided in Article 13.2:
(a) a decision that an anti-doping rule violation was committed, a decision imposing
Consequences or not imposing Consequences for an anti-doping rule violation, or a
decision that no anti-doping rule violation was committed; (b) the decision that an
anti-doping rule violation proceeding cannot be continued for procedural reasons
(including, for example, prescription); (e) a decision by Hyrox-World not to bring
forward an Adverse Analytical Finding or an Atypical Finding as an anti-doping rule
violation, or a decision not to go forward with an anti-doping rule violation after an
investigation in accordance with the International Standard for Results Management;
(f) a decision to impose, or lift, a Provisional Suspension as the result of a Provisional
Hearing; (g) Hyrox-World ́s failure to comply with Article 7.4; (h) a decision that Hyrox-
World lacks authority to rule on an alleged anti-doping rule violation or its
Consequences; (i) a decision to suspend, or not suspend, Consequences or to
reinstate, or not reinstate, Consequences under Article 10.7.1; (k) a failure to comply
with Article 10.8.1; (l) decision under Article 10.14.3; (m) a decision by Hyrox-World not
to implement another Anti-Doping Organization’s decision under Article 15.
13.2.1 Appeals Involving International-Level Athletes or International Events
[Comment by Hyrox-World: For the avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that
irrespective of HYROX’ nature as a cross-border sports competition, the events
organized by Hyrox-World shall not be deemed an International Event within the
meaning of Article 13.2.1 WADC and the Definitions of this Code respectively. The same
applies to the Athletes participating in HYROX events which shall not be deemed

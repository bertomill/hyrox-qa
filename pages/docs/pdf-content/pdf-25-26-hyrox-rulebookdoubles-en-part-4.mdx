The ranking system and the resulting overall ranking
is based on the fastest time in the respective division
of each event. Results are sorted from the fastest
to the slowest times. In addition, there is a ranking
within the age groups, also sorted from the fastest to
the slowest times.
If a racer competes twice within the same division,
only their fastest time will be considered for ranking
purposes, and they are not eligible to podium more
than once in that division for the same race.
The results will be published immediately after each
event ends, and will be available at results.hyrox.com.
Any incomplete running laps or deviation from
the prescribed repetition range or movement
standards will result in a penalty [see Penalties]
and/or disqualification. Penalties may be added or
amendments made for up to 48 hours after each
event ends.

5 WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
AND ELITE 15
The highlight of every HYROX season are the WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS [hereafter referred to as WORLDS].
Any HYROX racer starting at a regular HYROX event
can qualify for the annual HYROX WORLDS.
The qualification slots are limited to a specific
number for each division at an event. The number of
qualification slots per division will be announced on
the event page of each event city.
If a racer is placed within their age group and earns a
designated slot, they will be notified via email shortly
after the event.
The racer will receive an official email with an
invitation to register for the WORLDS within a stated
time frame, otherwise their slot will roll down to the
next best placed finisher in that same division. The
successful racer will compete at the WORLDS in the
age group that they qualified in, regardless of their
birthday.

GENERAL FAQ

WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN HYROX?

HYROX is the fitness race for everybody.

Everybody who is 16 and older can participate in a HYROX event! Anyone who participates in a sport, gym, fitness club, freeletics group or just loves to run is ideal for HYROX.

It is recommended you have a fitness background or regularly participate in fitness activities. You should have at least a minimal fitness level. The workouts are a combination of different natural movements combined with added weights.

The competition is broken up into divisions of HYROX Women/Men, HYROX Pro Women/Men HYROX Doubles and HYROX Relays, allowing everyone who is passionate about sports and fitness to properly challenge themselves and take part in the first fitness competition for everybody.

WHERE DO THE RACES TAKE PLACE?

HYROX is growing rapidly and is launching in more and more countries and cities around the world. The events are usually held in large indoor exhibition halls to ensure that there is enough space for a large number of athletes and to create equal conditions for all. Over 12000m2 of each event location covers 3 soccer fields!

Besides the race set-up, a lot of things await you in the venue: For example the warm-up area and the recovery area for athletes or the legendary HYROXWORLD where you can discover the latest HYROX Apparel collection, the original HYROX equipment, as well as many partner offers. Food trucks, cool DJ music, spectator stands and gym boxes create a special vibe.

HOW DO I BECOME A HYROX TRAINING CLUB?

3. Sled Pull
4. Burpee Broad Jumps

RACE DAY INFORMATION

WHAT IS THE CHECK-IN PROCEDURE?

Visit the race event page on hyrox.com for all registration details. If the event offers early registration, you’ll find the information there.

On-site registration is split into two areas: one for athletes and one for spectators. There’s also a help desk available for assistance.

Athlete registration opens 90 minutes before the first start wave of your division. If you’d like to enter the hall before your check-in time, go to the Spectator Desk with your ticket and ID.

Make sure to have your e-ticket (barcode) ready on your phone or printed out for check-in. We’ll scan it and give you your timing chip, which should be attached to your right ankle. If you lose the transponder, there will be a charge. All timing chips must be returned after the race at the finish area.

You’ll also receive a race wristband. Please wear it during the race so judges can assign you the correct weights.

WHAT TIME SHOULD I ARRIVE FOR MY RACE?

Venue doors open 90 minutes before the first wave.

We recommend athletes arrive 90 minutes before their division’s start time. This gives you enough time to register, drop off your bag (if needed), explore the venue, and warm up.

Your individual start time will be available online 3 days before the event. Please visit the event page on hyrox.com and click “start list” to locate your start time.

Your race number shows both your start time and your position in the wave. Be sure to be in the start tunnel 10 minutes before your scheduled start time.

**Example:** Race Number: 080030

- Athlete starts at 08:00 AM
- Athlete enters the start tunnel at 07:50 AM

SPORTOGRAF PHOTO PACKAGE – HOW DOES THAT WORK?

Our Official Photography Partner Sportograf will follow you during your race to capture your performance on camera. Through facial recognition technology, you can download your digital photo package after the event as a souvenir of your HYROX Race!

If you have pre-purchased your Sportograf Photo Package, follow the steps below to redeem it. For those that haven’t pre-purchased Sportograf, you will have the opportunity to purchase your photos post-race directly on the Sportograf website.

**How to Redeem Your Pre-Purchased Package After the Race**

Photos are taken of all participants during the race. Since you’ve pre-purchased your photo package, there’s no need to worry about “activating” anything on-site. Simply follow these steps to redeem your photos for free, approximately 48 hours after the race.

1. Go to sportograf.com/en and search for the respective HYROX event.
2. Enter the email address you used for race entry and click “Send Validation Link.”
3. Check your inbox for the email titled “Validation successful – Search for your images now” and click “Validate and Search.”
4. Upload a selfie.
5. Select “Buy Foto-Flat.”
6. Enter your Sportograf Ticket ID (below the barcode on your receipt) at checkout to bring the total to £0.

Important: Make sure your Sportograf ticket is personalised to reveal your Ticket ID – if not, log in to your HYROX account, to complete it.

CAN I SPECIFY MY HEAT TIME?

No, it is not possible to specify your heat time.

HOW IS MY RACE TIME MEASURED?

All participants wear a timing chip around their right ankle, which is handed out at registration on event day. The race course, as well as all workouts, are linked with timing technology, so that precise timing is guaranteed for each individual athlete. The finisher time and the exact split times of the individual workouts can be used to analyze your own performance afterwards and there is the possibility to compare yourself with other athletes worldwide and thus prepare even more specifically for the next race.

Our [Results & Rankings](https://results.hyrox.com/season-7/) page gives you an overview per division/ age group, individual results and an overview sorted by HYROX Seasons.Via the “SEARCH” button you can easily search for your final race times by entering your name.

WHAT IF I AM THE SLOWEST IN MY HEAT? IS THERE A TIME LIMIT TO COMPLETE IT?

When you start (unless you are the first wave), you will be entering the race course with many other athletes already on it. Therefore, it is extremely hard to see where you are in your heat! This takes all pressure off our athletes. There is no time limit on stations nor running so you can complete it at your own pace!

IS THERE AN ATHLETE BRIEFING ON-SITE?

For Singles and Doubles participants, please watch the Technical Briefing on the HYROX YouTube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToboRGZOv6s&list=PLXC5IKutF0pOIpgukuhDzH8CtYvVLmF94).

If you’re racing in the Relay division, you’ll receive a separate briefing on-site. The time and location will be posted on the event page on hyrox.com the week of the event. **Important:** Only one person from your relay team should attend the briefing. They will be responsible for sharing the information with the rest of the team. We limit the on-site briefing to one representative per team to keep the group small and ensure information is communicated efficiently.

BAG DROP, CHANGING ROOMS, SHOWERS?

We provide a bag drop and changing rooms at every event, but unfortunately, no showers are available. You can find the Venue Map with all the details on the event page via hyrox.com.

**Bag Drop Rules:**

- To avoid any last-minute rush, please arrive at the bag drop area **45-60 minutes before your start time**.
- Each participant is allowed to bring **one bag only**, no larger than a cabin-size bag.
- Please ensure everything fits in your bag, including your coat and any spare trainers.
- Make sure your bag is securely closed and all liquids or water bottles are tightly sealed. **HYROX is not responsible for liability for lost items.**
- Keep any race essentials like energy gels with you and remember to put your race chip on your ankle before you go to bag drop.
- Please note we’re unable to store bags for spectators due to space limitations, so please plan accordingly.Thank you for helping us keep the event running smoothly.

ARE SPECTATORS ALLOWED?

Spectators are welcome because there is nothing better than starting in front of friends or family, right?

The Spectator area has been designed so your support can be close to you at almost every workout. Spectator tickets, like athlete tickets, can be purchased online on the event page of the HYROX website (subject to availability).

Children under 12 do not need a ticket but must be accompanied by an adult.

**IMPORTANT:** Please be aware that spectator tickets are subject to availability. To avoid disappointment, please buy in advance via the HYROX website.

CAN I WEAR HEADPHONES?

Unfortunately no, you cannot wear your headphones while competing, please refer to the [Official HYROX Rulebooks here](https://hyrox.com/rulebook/) for more information on what you can and cannot have on you whilst you race.

CAN I CARRY WATER OR ENERGY GELS WITH ME AS I RACE?

Per our rulebook, you cannot take water with you across the course, unless it is attached to you in the form of a hydration pack. It is also not allowed for spectators to pass your water at any point. The same applies to energy gels.

Throughout the course, located in the Roxzone, we have hydration stations where you can stop to take a cup of water to drink before continuing your race.

ARE ANIMALS ALLOWED AT THE EVENT?

As much as we would like to make it possible: Animals are not allowed in the venues for insurance reasons and according to the house rules of the fairs.

ARE THERE WINNERS PRIZES?

For each division, there will be an age group winner’s ceremony for 1st-3rd place on the podium with a winner’s flag. Please refer to the Ceremony Times listed on the event page on hyrox.com for the official schedule!

Each HYROX finisher will receive a finisher patch at the finish line. Neither flags nor patches will be sent by post after the event.

I AM REGISTERED BUT CANNOT PARTICIPATE, WHAT CAN I DO?

Please read closely our [T&C](https://hyroxuk.com/en/terms-and-conditions/) for guidance on your options.

WHAT IF I FALL SICK/ INJURED PRIOR TO MY RACE?

Please read closely our [T&C](https://hyroxuk.com/en/terms-and-conditions/) for guidance on your options.

WHAT DO I DO IF I GET NAUSEOUS OR INJURED DURING MY RACE?

You have the option to pull out of the race at any time. We have staff all along the course and at the different workout stations who will send medics to take care of you in case of an emergency.

WHO CONTROLS COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES?

At each event, Head Judges share responsibility for the 8 workout stations and the running course, ensuring that the event runs smoothly and that competition standards are maintained. They are supported by a large pool of judges who keep a close eye on the action at all times.

HOW DO I QUALIFY FOR THE HYROX WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS?

At each race, the top finishers in **certain age groups will** qualify for the World Championships, the ultimate HYROX showdown at the end of each HYROX Season. Qualification slots are given in proportion to the number of athletes taking part. **The exact number will always be published the week of the race via our official social media channels for the respective event.** If you have qualified for the World Championships, you will be sent a ticket invitation via the email you used to sign up. All qualified athletes will have 48 hours to claim their tickets. A starting place at the World Championships has, like the normal events, a ticket fee. A World Championships ticket is excluded from the rebooking regulations. Any unclaimed tickets will be rolled down to the next athlete in line.

After the 48-hour deadline, the second qualification round will start. This means that qualifying places that are **not** **claimed** will be given to the next athlete in the backlog procedure. The 48-hour deadline also applies here. If a spot is not claimed within the deadline, the starting place for the respective person will be forfeited. **Important:** Please note that tickets are sent to each qualified athlete. In doubles, **both** athletes need to claim their ticket within the 48-hour window to secure their spot.

**Note:** There are **no** qualification spots for the HYROX Relay.

WHAT ARE THE DIVISIONS AT THE HYROX WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS?

At the World Championships, all competitors will compete in the HYROX Race with Pro weights. This applies to all athletes who have qualified in the Open and Doubles categories, with the exception of the Mixed Doubles & 60+ athletes who will compete with the Open weights.

FLEX ADD-ON (SEASON 25/26 ONLY)

HOW DOES THE REFUND WORK?

If you have purchased the Flex Add-On, you can request a full refund directly via your account until 7 days prior to the race (07:59am) and a 50% refund until the day before your race (07:59am). Your refund will be processed automatically.

WILL RETURNED TICKETS BE PUT BACK ON SALE IMMEDIATELY?

Returned tickets won’t be immediately resold after a refund. However, leading up to the event, any returned tickets will be made available for purchase. If you missed out on tickets during the initial launch, keep an eye out—you may have a chance to grab one last minute.

CAN I REFUND MY SPORTOGRAF TICKET?

Yes, add-ons such as Sportograf can be refunded as well if you have bought the Flex Add-On.

HOW DO I CHANGE THE NAME ON MY TICKET?

If you’ve purchased a Doubles or Relay ticket with the Flex Add-On, you’re entitled to one name change. To do this:

- First, make sure the ticket is personalised with the original athlete’s name and details.
- Once personalisation is complete, the option to “Re-personalise” will appear in your HYROX Account.
- You can then update the ticket with the new athlete’s information.

Important: Name changes can only be made after the ticket has been personalised.

WHEN CAN I PURCHASE THE FLEX ADD-ON UNTIL?

The Flex Add-On is only available during the purchase of your athlete ticket. It remains available throughout the ticket purchase process, up until 4 weeks before the race. After that point, only regular tickets (without the Flex Add-On) will be available, until the race is sold out. It is not possible to book the Flex Add-On after the initial booking.

WHAT IF I DON’T BUY THE FLEX ADD-ON?

If you decide not to purchase the Flex Add-On, please note that ticket transfers, refunds, or name changes will not be possible after purchase. The Flex Add-On cannot be added after your purchase is complete. Additionally, transferring your ticket to another event is not available, regardless of whether you select the Flex Add-On.

CAN I TRANSFER MY TICKET TO ANOTHER EVENT?

No, transferring to another event is not an option with or without the Flex Add-On.

CAN I SWITCH FROM DOUBLES TO SINGLES OR CHANGE DOUBLES DIVISIONS (E.G. FROM WOMEN’S DOUBLES TO MIXED DOUBLES) IF MY PARTNER IS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND?

Unfortunately, division changes are not allowed. If you purchased a ticket with the Flex Add-On, you can request a refund or change the name of your doubles partner, but the ticket must remain in the same division. This means the new partner must be the same gender as the original one. If you purchased a ticket without the Flex Add-On, we’re unable to offer any changes or alternatives.

DO YOU ACCEPT EXCEPTIONS CLOSE TO THE RACE OR ON-SITE AT THE EVENT IF SOMEONE HAS BOUGHT A TICKET WITHOUT THE FLEX ADD-ON BUT IS STILL UNABLE TO ATTEND?

No, we will not accept any exceptions.

DOES THE SAME RULE APPLY TO EARLY ACCESS TICKETS PURCHASED THROUGH A TRAINING CLUB ACCESS?

Yes, the same rules apply. We highly recommend that gym owners, purchasing multiple tickets, purchase the Flex Add-On.

IF I AM COMING FROM A PARTNER OR I HAVE BEEN A VOLUNTEER, CAN I PURCHASE THE REFUNDABLE TICKET WITH MY 50/100% VOUCHER?

Yes, but you will be responsible for paying the fee for the Flex Add-On. If you would like to request a name change, you will need to contact Customer Service as this is not automatically available from your account. If you are a volunteer and want to return your ticket, please contact Customer Service and they will reactivate your code (as long as it is still within the 12 month window).

# 25 26 HYROX RulebookRelay EN - Part 7 of 18

*Part 7 of 18 from 25_26_HYROX_RulebookRelay_EN.pdf (35 pages total)*

3 After completing the required distance, the racer
must remain with both feet on the platform and
raise an arm to signal to a Judge that the required
distance has been completed.
4 The racer may only leave their SkiErg upon
receiving the Judge’s confirmation of completion.
5 The damper setting on the ergometer is preset to
resistance 6 for all divisions–this may be adjusted
as many times as desired by the working DTM
[only].
6 The resting DTM remains in the marked area. It is
not allowed to pass the SkiErg handles from one
DTM to the other.
1 If the racer’s feet move from the SkiErg base, this
will result in a formal warning.
2 A second infringement will result in a 15-second
penalty.
3 Each subsequent infringement will incur an
additional 15-second penalty–no further warnings
will be issued.
4 If the racer leaves before completing the 1,000
meters, they will receive a time penalty or be
disqualified, depending on the severity of the
violation.
SKIERG PENALTY PROTOCOL
1 Each racer will be assigned a sled lane by a
member of the judging team. It is mandatory that
the racer uses the assigned sled lane.
2 Both sled and racer must be completely behind
the white line prior to starting.
3 Both sled and racer must stay within their
designated lane and not interfere with a
neighbouring lane in any way.
4 The sled must always pass the 12.5m mark [end
of the lane] entirely before changing direction.
5 As soon as the racer completes 4 x 12.5m lanes
and the entire sled passes the line, the station is
complete.
6 If the racer completes less than four lanes, a
penalty of 3 minutes per missing lane will be
applied.
6.2 SLED PUSH
DISTANCE:
50 METERS

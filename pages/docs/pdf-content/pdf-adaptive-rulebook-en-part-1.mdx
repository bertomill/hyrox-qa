# ADAPTIVE RULEBOOK EN - Part 1 of 14

*Part 1 of 14 from ADAPTIVE_RULEBOOK_EN.pdf (24 pages total)*

HYROX Adaptive Rulebook R3 Season 2024/25

1.CONCEPT
HYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition, is based on an
idea by Upsolut Sports founder Christian Toetzke and involves a
combination of running and functional movements. The race was created
by Mintra Tilly, who also authored this rulebook with valuable input from
George Thompson of the Matt Hampson Foundation, Sylvania Harrod,
Maurice-André Iseli and many others who contributed through testing
and feedback. Their collective efforts helped shape and refine the rules to
ensure the best experience for all participants.
HYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by one workout, repeated 8 times.
In order to complete the entire HYROX race and receive a valid finishing
time, the participants must complete the runs and workouts in the specific
order (run, workout, run, workout, etc.) until they have completed a total of
8 km running and 8 workouts. Whilst the repetition range and/or weights
differ between the divisions, the running distance remains the same
across all divisions: each participant must run 1 km before each workout,
i.e. a total distance of 8 km.
The results and ranking system  are based on the fastest time in each
respective division. Results are sorted from the fastest to the slowest time.

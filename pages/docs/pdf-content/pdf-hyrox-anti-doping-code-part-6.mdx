*Part 6 of 43 from HYROX-Anti-Doping-Code.pdf (27 pages total)*

3.1 Burdens and Standards of Proof
HYROX-World shall have the burden of establishing that an anti-doping rule violation
has occurred. The standard of proof shall be whether HYROX-World has established
an anti-doping rule violation to the comfortable satisfaction of the hearing panel,
bearing in mind the seriousness of the allegation which is made. This standard of
proof in all cases is greater than a mere balance of probability (thus greater than
50%+1) but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt (thus less than 100%).
Where this Code places the burden of proof upon the Athlete or other Person alleged
to have committed an anti-doping rule violation to rebut a presumption or establish
specified facts or circumstances, except as provided in Articles 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, the
standard of proof shall be by a balance of probability (thus equal to 50%+ 1).
3.2 Methods of Establishing Facts and Presumptions
Facts related to anti-doping rule violations may be established by any reliable means,
including admissions, whereby the following rules of proof shall be applied:
3.2.1 Analytical methods or Decision Limits approved by WADA after consultation within
the relevant scientific community or which have been the subject of peer review are
